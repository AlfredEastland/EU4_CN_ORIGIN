 string_start_irish_minors:0 "§YIreland§! in [GetYear] is divided among many disparate clans in the wake of the collapse of direct §YEnglish§! rule. English control is now limited to a small area around Dublin, known as the §YPale§!.\n\nImmediately beyond the Pale are the domains of the Peerage of Ireland, the Earls of §YDesmond§!, §YOrmond§!, §YUlster§!, and §YKildare§!. These lords once governed in the name of the English crown, but their fealty is now nominal at best. They reign independently and often in defiance of English influence. Over the centuries the transplanted Anglo-Norman nobility have become as Irish as the population they govern. §YOffaly§! and §YLeinster§! are surrounded by potential enemies but also by opportunities for an aggressive ruler.\n\nIn the north, the Earldoms of §YTyrone§!, §YTyrconnel§!, and Ulster sit precariously in the path of both English and §YScottish§! expansionism. The §YO’Neill§! clan of Tyrone may have to put aside their pride and consider an alliance with one of these powers if they ever wish to restore the legacy of their legendary ancestor, High King Niall of the Nine Hostages.\n\n§YThomond§!, §YSligo§!, §YClanricarde§!, and §YMunster§! in the west and south are relatively safe from the ambitions of regional powers, at least for the time being. These clans have long and storied histories, claiming descent from Irish heroes such as Brian Boru and Carthach the Elder. If they choose to seize it, they have the opportunity to expand throughout Ireland and become powers in their own right.\n\nAn Ireland united by a High King seems like a distant dream, but a dynasty that can overcome both their Irish rivals and the English invaders may yet claim that title once again."
 string_start_provence:0 "In [GetYear], §YProvence§! is ruled by ambitious René d'Anjou, who styles himself not only as Duke of Anjou and Count of Provence, but also as the King of §YAragon§!, §YNaples§!, and §YJerusalem§!. The lords of Christendom pay little heed to these claims, yet Good King René is determined to reclaim his birthright.\n\nProvence controls a divided domain. Anjou is at the heart of the conflict between §YEngland§! and §YFrance§!, desired by both nations and likely to suffer from the coming wars. Provencal land in the Rhineland is split between the directly ruled Duchy of Bar and the subject Duchy of §YLorraine§!. Provence risks the ire of both the Holy Roman Emperor and the powerful Duchy of §YBurgundy§! if it chooses to meddle in affairs of the Rhineland Princes. The Duchy of Provence itself lies on the north coast of the Mediterranean, nested between France, §YSavoy§!, and the §YPapal§! city of Avignon. From here the ambitious René may launch an invasion of Aragon, though Italy may be a more tempting prize as the Empire’s hold over the region wanes.\n\nProvence maintains good relations with its largest and most powerful neighbor, France. Provence must balance its own defensive needs and plans for expansion with French expectations of support should the Hundred Years war once again break out into open war.\n\nProvence is a nation with great ambitions, but even staving off annihilation may prove to be a challenge as surrounding nations eye its’ lands greedily."
 string_start_brittany:0 "§YBrittany’s§! situation in [GetYear] is much the same as in previous centuries. Caught between §YEngland§! and §YFrance§!, its Dukes have long had to struggle to maintain independence. France in particular has repeatedly made diplomatic and military attempts to annex Britanny into its domain.\n\nThe Second Treaty of Guérande, signed in 1381, formally declared Brittany neutral in the Hundred Years War. This conflict seems likely to once again lead to hostilities, as French demands for the surrender of §YMaine§! go unmet by England. How far the Dukes of Brittany will honour their promise of neutrality remains to be seen; there could be much to gain from involvement in the war, but also many dangers. Brittany is unlikely to be able to stand against either of the warring powers alone, and to that end may consider cooperation with the rising power of §YBurgundy§!.\n\nBrittany is a rich and fertile land with much potential for development. The capital of §YNantes§! has seen grand reconstruction efforts following a bloody succession war and currently stands as one of the major Atlantic port cities. The port of Brest meanwhile would make an ideal naval dockyard, being both a sheltered natural harbour and strategically located to intercept both French and English fleets.\n\nBrittany must choose its friends and enemies carefully if it’s to survive in the modern era. If the tumultuous politics of Europe fail to offer opportunities, perhaps Brittany’s destiny may lie beyond its shores."
 string_start_scotland:0 "By [GetYear] §YScotland§! has stood steadfast, fighting for and winning its independence from its would-be §YEnglish§! overlords. Scotland threw off the yoke of English rule after Robert the Bruce routed the English at Bannockburn in 1314, and has since consolidated its control over northern Britain.\n\nScotland’s protection comes not only from its brave armies, but also from the Auld Alliance with §YFrance§!. This agreement obligates France to come to Scotland’s aid should England once again try to subjugate them. War is an ever-present possibility as the marcher lords on both sides of the border threaten to escalate conflict through frequent skirmishes and a tendency to opportunistically switch sides for the sake of better raiding opportunities.\n\nIt has taken many years for Scotland to incorporate the §YHighlands§! into the kingdom. The Middle Ages saw the annexation of the formerly autonomous Kingdom of Moray, home of the usurper Macbeth, and the expansion of feudal institutions into the northern mainland. The integration of the Highlands would serve Scotland well as it became a staging ground for recruitment in the war against Edward Longshanks. The Hebrides were wrested away from the former Kingdom of the Isles under Alexander II, and not even the intervention of the King of §YNorway§! could halt the Scottish assault.\n\nKing James II has plans to further extend the Scottish domain in the surrounding isles. §YOrkney and the Shetlands§! are held by Norway, which is itself currently subject to §YDenmark§!. Taking on the full might of Scandinavia would be challenging, but perhaps a diplomatic solution will present itself. England and Scotland have squabbled over the §YIsle of Mann§! for centuries. Currently the English have the upper hand, but an opportunistic ruler might exploit their preoccupation with fighting France to seize it for themselves.\n\nThe House of §YStuart§! has ruled Scotland for less than a century, but they have ruled well. If Scotland is able to turn the tide against England, the Stuarts could one day rule all of the British Isles."
 string_start_western_japan:0 "In name the Empire of §YJapan§! is ruled by Emperor Go-Hanazono from Kyoto, the latest in a 2000 year line of emperors. In practice however the government of the realm has been left to the Shogun, nominally the emperor's deputy in military matters. In [GetYear] the Shogunate is not what it once was, however. In 1441 the unpopular Shogun Yoshinori was assassinated by the §YAkamatsu§! clan, starting a process of increasingly strong local lords.\n\nThe §YHosokawa§! clan was one of the founding clans of the current Shogunate and remains one of the most powerful families in Japan. They control more territory than any other clan and have great influence at court.\n\nSince the assassination of Yoshinori the §YYamana§! have come to absorb most of the territories previously held by the Akamatsu. Their rise have quickly made them a force to be reckoned with in Western Japan, challenging the Hosokawa dominance.\n\nThe decreasing grasp of central authority has also given rise to a marked increase in piracy and smuggling, with many small lords turning a blind eye or even encouraging raids into foreign waters. Others, such as the §YOuchi§! and the venerable Hosokawa, would instead try to profit from the highly regulated foreign trade with these countries.\n\nAt the turn of [GetYear] there is conflict brewing conflict between the Yamana and Hosokawa. For the time being open conflict seems distant, but their great power and competing interests ensure that even a minor incident could spiral into a major conflict. Such a conflict might be what the smaller clans of the region, such as §YAmago§!, §YKono§!, §YOtomo§!, §YShoni§!, §YKikuchi§!, §YIto§! and §YShimazu§! would need to advance their positions. Many of these clans have an old and honorable history, having held their domains since the Kamakura period."
 string_start_austria:0 "In 1438 the §YHabsburg§! dynasty had reached some of the most influential positions in Central Europe. Albert the Magnanimous was able to claim not only the duchy of §YAustria§! but also the kingdoms of §YHungary§! and §YBohemia§! as well as the prestigious title ‘King-Elect of Germany’, reserved for those about to be made §YEmperors§! of the §YHoly Roman Empire§!. Misfortune struck however and Albert fell in battle against the Turks in 1439, leaving only his yet unborn son, Ladislaus the Posthumous, to succeed him.\n\nNewborn Ladislaus would have a hard time claiming his legacy, and lost the throne of Hungary after a short civil war to the §YPolish§! King Wladyslaw. The Kingdom of Bohemia on the other hand is still divided on the issue. Decades of religious civil wars have left the country ravaged with some parts still dominated by powerful Hussite nobles, heretics to the Catholic faith.\nOnly in Austria, the homeland of the Habsburg dynasty, has Ladislaus been accepted, though his uncle §YFrederick§! now rules as his regent.\n\nWith the catastrophe of Varna the Hungarian throne is again vacant, and Habsburg supporters remain hopeful that it can be reclaimed for Ladislaus. The powerful groups that deposed the boy king once do not seem disposed to accept him a second time. They may well let their dynamic Hungarian regent Janos Hunyadi lead them instead.\n\nThe dream of a Habsburg Emperor was not lost with Albert. Upon his death, Frederick, the Austrian regent, was elected to lead the Holy Roman Empire. As the first of his family to sit on the Imperial throne Frederick will leave a legacy for future Habsburgs. Should they choose to pursue his careful policies of diplomatic marriages and patient inheritance planning, the Habsburgs may well build up a position of power unlike that of any family among the kings of Europe. The responsibilities of Imperial rule are great obstacles in themselves. An Emperor must keep the peace in the empire, fight heresy such as the recent Hussites and at all costs protect Christianity from the advancing armies of the §YOttomans§!, a power to which the Habsburgs have already lost one King."
 string_start_muscovy:0 "At the end of [GetYear] §YRussia§! is divided in a number of principalities, all of whom have for a long time lived in the shadow of the Tatar §YGolden Horde§!. The Tatars have been ever present in Russian politics, collecting tribute, taxes and acting as kingmakers in the Christian states. While the Grand Principality of Muscovy is not the oldest of these states it has recently grown to be the strongest. Located in the relatively fertile Opolye, Muscovy has a stronger internal economy than many other principalities. More importantly their princes have often acted as collectors for the Khans of the Golden Hordes. Making their princes both relatively safe and able to grow rich.\n\nSince the crushing defeat of the Golden Horde at the hands of the §YTimurid§! armies, their empire has fractured into a number of successor states. The core of their empire, the §YGreat Horde§! is still a strong power in its own right, but it is fraught by internal struggles and has been unable to project much power over the Russians\n\nMuscovy has made good use of this power vacuum, expanding their control over the other principalities rapidly, through both cunning and use of military resources. Often even by simply buying out the poorer Princes and adding their lands to the Muscovite domain.\n\nMoscow is not the only strong state with interest in the Russian region, however, in the north the Republic of §YNovgorod§! has colonized much of the white sea coastline, securing the valuable waterways and a source of fur, the soft gold of the north and east.\n\nTo the west the Grand Duchy of §YLithuania§! and the Kingdom of §YPoland§! are doing what they can to assume the leadership of all Russias, asserting authority over most Ruthenian lands as well as a constant factor in the politics of the free Russian states in the north. Their interests are directly opposed to the growing power of Moscow, but their claim to the Rus legacy is quite dubious. If they can be overcome there is seemingly no limit to how much the Great Principality could grow.\n\nIf the Tatar Yoke could be crushed once and for all there is also the vast expanse of §YSiberia§!, full of untold riches, and dangers. If the many khanates, natives and the nature itself can be overcome then there is no limit to how rich a united Russian state could grow."
