 mth_siege_mentality_desc:0 "The people of Dublin and Meath have had to endure many sieges through the years. We understand how to survive them and how to resist them."

 fri_coastal_industry_desc:0 "As trade begins to blossom in the North Sea, so too does our importance in the area. Our people's natural skill at sea-faring will prove most useful in the coming years."
 fri_upstalsboom_league:0 "The Upstalsboom League"
 fri_upstalsboom_league_desc:0 "The Frisian dream of true Republicanism has had many setbacks. Since the 12th Century, we have striven against feudalism; perhaps now it is the time to constitutionalize our ideals."
 fri_zuiderzee_settlements:0 "The Zuider Embankments"
 fri_zuiderzee_settlements_desc:0 "Horrific floods have plagued the coast of Frisia from time immemorial. Our engineers have done such a remarkable job on shoring up the vast embankments and dykes that hold back the sea, that we believe they may be among the finest in the world."
 fri_flooding_polders:0 "Flooding the Polders"
 fri_flooding_polders_desc:0 "The landscape of Frisia has been dotted with artificially-irrigated enclosed fields called Polders, for centuries. It was only recently that we realised their superb potential for combating invasion. By opening the floodgates, we can render our territory all but impenetrable."

 fri_mennonism_desc:0 "As debate in Europe becomes ever more heated regarding the Divine, we strive to promote our legacy of tolerance, understanding, and friendship."
 fri_brothers_arms:0 "Brothers in Arms"

 fri_dutch_courage:0 "Dutch Courage"
 fri_dutch_courage_desc:0 "Foreign soldiers often remark on the bravery of our troops. Whether their bravery is caused by rations of gin as the foreigners believe, or by our superlative training regimen, it is not clear."

 utr_devotio_moderna:0 "Devotio Moderna"

 utr_ex_cathedra:0 "Ex Cathedra"
 utr_ex_cathedra_desc:0 "Utrecht has, for many centuries, been the highly influential seat of a Prince-Bishop. Latterly, the voice of Utrecht has been drowned out by the clamor of sycophantic lip-service from those who would ingratiate themselves in the eyes of God. By issuing a nationwide proclamation in support of our divine heritage, we reaffirm our status in God's kingdom."
 utr_fortified_town:0 "Fortified City"
 utr_fortified_town_desc:0 "The walls of Utrecht withstand anything our enemies can bring to bear. Our artisan engineers make sure our legacy stands, and will stand, well into the future."

 utr_vaartse_rijn_desc:0 "This canal links Utrecht to the Hollandse IJssel, and brings with it all manner of foreign trade. By expanding the network of tributary canals around Utrecht, and indeed, the rest of our country, we open up a thriving market to our populace."

 utr_cultural_resilience_desc:0 "No invasion or foreign occupation has blunted the desire of every citizen of Utrecht to be free. We notice that our brothers in the Low Countries hold many of the same beliefs and values as us - perhaps it is time we extended the hand of friendship?"
 utr_enlightenment_masses:0 "Enlightenment of the Masses"
 utr_enlightenment_masses_desc:0 "In this era of wonders, the education of our people is of paramount importance. Universities and schools are springing up from East to West. Let us embrace this knowledge for the betterment of Man."

 fla_noose_bearers:0 "Noose-Bearers"

 lie_wittelsbach_bishops:0 "Wittelsbach Bishops"
 lie_wittelsbach_bishops_desc:0 "The noble house of Wittelsbach is both prestigious and vast. Those among their number who take the cloth should be invited to serve as Prince-Bishops in Liège. While this would entangle us in the dynastic politics of the German Princes, it would also improve our ability to conduct diplomacy in Imperial courts."
 lie_prince_bishop_palace:0 "The Prince-Bishop's Palace"
 lie_prince_bishop_palace_desc:0 "The old Palace is a broken ruin, not fit for a modern ruler. Our Prince-Bishop must have a palace the equal of any other Prince of the Holy Roman Empire."

 gel_hanseatic:0 "Hanseatic Towns"

 gel_defy_burgundy:0 "Defiance of Foreign Rule"

 gel_gelderland_wars_desc:0 "Gelre is no stranger to military conflict, and its armies once again stand ready to expand our borders by force. Our motivations of course are not purely expansionist - we also seek to defend the Low Countries from the encroachment of foreign kings."
 gel_looting:0 "Loot as Payment"
 gel_looting_desc:0 "It is always difficult to muster the coin to pay soldiers. As an alternative to payment by the state, many soldiers and mercenaries are willing to accept instead the right to plunder the land of whatever valuables they come across on their campaigns."
 gel_diplomatic_expansion:0 "Land Negotiations"
 gel_diplomatic_expansion_desc:0 "Outright conquest is the simplest method of claiming new territories, but there is much to be said also for a diplomatic approach. Through strategic marriages and moneylending, our realm has expanded from minor holdings in Upper Guelders to its current size. Holland and Utrecht have loaned more from our plentiful treasury than they could pay back, and we have obtained Nijmegen and the Veluwe as collateral. We must obtain more lands following this example."

 efr_chiefs_desc:0 "East Frisia has thus far survived without becoming a feudal society.

 efr_saxon_feud:0 "The Saxon Feud"
 efr_saxon_feud_desc:0 "Several feudal rulers claim our land as their own, among them the Dukes of Saxony and Counts of Oldenburg. Our struggles with our German neighbors leave a lasting impression on our military tradition."
 efr_religious_thought:0 "Center of Religious Thought"
 efr_religious_thought_desc:0 "The many theologies of the Reformation shall find a home in East Frisia. While perhaps a doomed effort, we should attempt to discover whether a peaceful middle ground might exist between Catholicism and the ideals of the Reformation."

 aac_guilds:0 "Guild and Government"
 aac_guilds_desc:0 "Like many cities in the Germany, the guilds have influence over governance.

 aac_expel_heretics:0 "Expel Heretical Officials"
 aac_expel_heretics_desc:0 "As city officials flip to and from Catholicism and the various reformed sects, we must decide on a single faith for the city and expel any officials that do not conform."
 aac_baroque:0 "Baroque Architecture"
 aac_baroque_desc:0 "There are many grand buildings in Aachen that have fallen into disrepair through war and neglect. This presents an opportunity to rebuild in new architectural styles.

 aac_congresses:0 "Congresses of Aachen"
 aac_congresses_desc:0 "As the dust settles after a great war in Europe, leaders must come to the peace table to resolve conflicts. There is no better site than Charlemagne's capital to host these international conferences that will surely bring about a new era of peace in Europe."
