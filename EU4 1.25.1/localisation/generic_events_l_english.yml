From north to south the ordinary Chinese are questioning his rule and the normally so loyal bureaucrats are debating if [empire_of_china.Monarch.GetName] has in fact lost the Mandate of Heaven.\nRogue [chinese_border_province.Culture.GetName] officials, claiming to represent [chinese_border_province.GetName] have approached [Root.Monarch.GetName] imploring us to free them from the oppression of [empire_of_china.GetName] and ending the rule of the [empire_of_china.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty."

Our nobles, led by the demanding [Root.capital_noble.GetName], are starting to worry that [Root.Heir.GetName] will favor [Root.given_teacher_culture.GetCultureName] subjects when [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] becomes ascends the throne and have begun to plot against [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] and [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] at court. They demand that we chastize the [Root.Heir.GetTitle] and guarantee the rights of the nobility."
