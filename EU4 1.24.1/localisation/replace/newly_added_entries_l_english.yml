This is often the only way for soldiers to survive in wartime as payments from the [Root.GovernmentName] treasury can rarely be brought in a timely manner to the men. In fact, by paying retroactively many also avoid the strain of paying for the fallen.\nAs [From.GetCapitalName] fell it was therefore expected that our soldiers be allowed to loot the city to enrich themselves. What was less expected was the total and utter destruction of the city that took place. Refusing to follow orders our men descended upon the helpless burghers, doing despicable things and ruining the area for a long time to come."

As the season for salary payment draws nearer it is becoming abundantly clear that we will not be able to pay all troops as there is simply no way for the money to get to them on time. Our generals blame constant enemy raids on the baggage train and insist they planned everything in detail, but the problem is now [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s to solve.\nIf we only pay a fraction of our troops many will no doubt desert.\nWe could also choose to pay none of them and tell them to live off the land, but that would likely devastate the entire area."

# army_professionalism_events.5.t:0 "The many jobs of a Soldier"
# army_professionalism_events.5.d:0 "Prolonged peacetime and changes in the economy has lead to many of our salaried soldiers no longer considering the pensions we pay them sufficient. An increasing number of them have turned to other daily work such as shopkeeping or craftsmanship, earning a better living in their city homes.\nWhile this can stimulate the local economy it does mean that these troopers are no longer maintaining, or practicing with, the equipment we have provided them. In order to stop this trend we would have to increase their pay substantially."

Of course the [professional_country.GetStateForm] of [professional_country.GetName] does not take kindly upon those of its officers that would seek employment abroad and would likely disapprove if we tried to entice any subject of theirs.\nThat does not mean, however, that there are not individuals who would be interested in such a career opportunity, if we made it worth their while."

# army_professionalism_events.8.a:0 "Allow them to re-enact the battle."
# army_professionalism_events.8.b:0 "We will soon give them a real war to try their theories in."
# army_professionalism_events.9.t:0 "Private Contractors"
# army_professionalism_events.9.d:0 "Due to lack of permanent structures many armies rely on private contractors to provide everything from equipment to entire regiments. Usually these entrepreneurs receive a sum in advance that they can then use to procure what the army needs on short notice. This often works well to meet the swiftly changing needs of our troops during campaigns, but there are those that would take advantage of the system.\nAs our armies in [enemy_country.GetName] advance deeper into enemy territory there are increasing reports of corruption and unwarranted cooperation between our logistical officers and local entrepreneurs. If we are to maintain efficiency we must root out these practices but in the short run we will risk disrupting the system even more by fighting the corruption."

The old [Root.GetNoblesReplacementForOtherGovernments], however, still expect to be awarded all the most valuable commissions out of tradition and the centuries during which their lineages have served the [Root.GetStateForm] faithfully.\nSome of our higher officers are now imploring us to open more opportunities for able men to rise in the ranks, while others oppose this vehemently and maintain that there are qualities only blood can assure."
# army_professionalism_events.10.a:0 "We must safeguard the ancient traditions of our officer corps."

# army_professionalism_events.11.t:0 "Esprit de Corps"
# army_professionalism_events.11.d:0 "The strain, that the military lifestyle puts the men who serve under, can under good circumstances lead to the development of a spirit of belonging and cooperation that greatly strengthens the armed forces. During the recent conflict with [enemy_country.GetName] we have seen clear signs that our troops are working better together and that they have formed strong bonds of loyalty and duty to the [Root.GetName] [Root.GetStateForm] that would have seemed hard to imagine just a few years ago."
# army_professionalism_events.11.a:0 "This is what separates the [Root.GetAdjective] troops from all other."
# army_professionalism_events.12.t:0 "Lack of Officers"
# army_professionalism_events.12.d:0 "In order to keep a sizable professional army efficient a sufficient number of trained officers are required to carry out the orders and will of the [Root.GetStateForm]. However, the increased demand on quality leadership is not matched by the number of officers on our rolls.\nWith increased demands on quality new officers also take longer to train and are harder to recruit."
# army_professionalism_events.12.a:0 "Shorten the training."
# army_professionalism_events.12.b:0 "Increase recruitment."
# army_professionalism_events.13.t:0 "Local Militias"
# army_professionalism_events.13.d:0 "Many military duties are not performed by the professional armies of the [Root.GetStateForm] but rather by local militias based around the cities, castles and forts in the various parts of our country. These militias often know the local area well and provide very good value for money as garrisons, scouts and gatherers of intelligence but their quality as regular troops are very varied to say the least.\nIt has been suggested that we send professional soldiers to at least instruct all militias in the country and that we rely less on them when conducting operations in many areas. This would, according to our generals, lead to an increase in quality and make us less vulnerable to things we cannot control. It would, however, also most likely mean dismissing a great number of our reserve troops."
# army_professionalism_events.13.a:0 "We need the militias."

# army_professionalism_events.15.a:0 "Great."
# army_professionalism_events.16.t:0 "Treason against [Root.GetDefiniteArticleBeforePluralCountry][Root.GetName]"
# army_professionalism_events.16.d:0 "Recruitment is out of necessity something that has to be a somewhat decentralized affair. Often it will be entrusted to [Root.GetNoblesReplacementForOtherGovernments] in the capital, and then they are responsible to turn up a set number of men in the various provinces under our control.\nThis is a system that to some extent relies on trust as the central government is not involved in the details of countryside mustering, and the only form of control we have are the, often sporadic, inspections the army itself conducts. One such inspection in [cheating_rolls.GetName] has unearthed quite a local scandal. The rolls we have for the area is full of fictional names and nobody seems to know what we could actually muster from the region."
# army_professionalism_events.16.a:0 "This is unfortunate."

# army_professionalism_events.17.t:0 "Proliferation of the Musket"

# yemen_nation_desc:0 "For too long the fertile lands of Yemen have suffered in the hands of incompetent dynasties intent only on plundering her treasures. We must unite these lands so that they can once again prosper under an able ruler."
# georgia_nation_desc:0 "Ever since the abdication of Alexander I Georgia has been divided and devastated by in-fighting. This has allowed other countries to control the internal politics of the region and oppress our people.\nThe time has come to once again unite the Georgian people and reforge the kingdom that was once lost!"

 turkish_nation_title:0 "重建罗姆苏丹国"
# turkish_nation_desc:0 "Once, the Sultanate of Rûm united all the Turkish Beys and Emirs of Anatolia, but it was brought down by jealous and deceitful enemies from afar. By tearing down the empires that defile the memory of the Seljuk dynasty we can restore the Sultanate that once was. Let us unite the Beys under our banner and bring destruction upon those that would dream themselves our overlords!"
 state_firearm_regiments_title:0 "国家火器军团"
# state_firearm_regiments_desc:0 "While the technology is still in its infancy, firearms can be a deadly force on any battlefield. In order to be efficient, however, firearms require regular training and a steady supply of ammunition. For a regular levy army this level of proficiency can be hard to maintain. A soldier that has to go home to tend his fields is not one that will regularly exercise with his weapon.\nWhile we cannot change our entire army structure in one stroke we can ensure that a core of highly trained salaried troops specialize in these weapons."

 standardized_uniforms_title:0 "标准化制服"
# standardized_uniforms_desc:0 "To the extent that uniforms are in use in our armies regiment commanders are often expected to provide and pay for them. This leads to a great variety in colors and styles on the battlefield and makes identifying friend from foe confusing. Let us create a standard uniform for all troops on our payrolls that we then attempt to provide for our troops."
 abolish_standardized_uniforms_title:0 "废除标准化制服"
# abolish_standardized_uniforms_desc:0 "There are many upsides to the state supplying standardized uniforms but it is perhaps cheaper and more efficient to have regimental commanders pay and commission them instead. We could go back to the way things were even if our army professionalism would suffer somewhat."
 abolish_state_firearm_regiments_title:0 "废除我们的精锐火器军团"
# abolish_state_firearm_regiments_desc:0 "We are paying far too much for new technology and new methods. We should strive to lift the entire army and not just a few pioneers."

# armenia_nation_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Armenia once dominated the Caucasus. Time was not kind to our ancestors, however, and neighboring empires saw weakness in our internal divisions and used it to conquer our people. Let us drive out these invaders and re-establish the Kingdom and Church of Armenia."
 timurid_nation_title:0 "宣称帖木儿的遗产"
# timurid_nation_desc:0 "As the descendant of Timur Lenk, the great conqueror of Iran, Transoxiana and Khorasan, it is our duty to reclaim his legacy. With the traditional Timurid Strongholds under our control we can at last proclaim ourselves the head of Timur's dynasty, and the leader of all of the Ghurkani princes."
# enthrone_timurid_prince_title:0 "Enthrone Timurid Prince"
# enthrone_timurid_prince_desc:0 "Amir Timur once crushed all realms in this region and entrusted their rule to his relatives. Ever since they have been torn apart by the Timurid princes' lust to rule it all, and there are many princes who could yet stake their claim to Timur's empire. Some local rulers have been known to invite Timurid claimants to their states, propping them up as leaders, and using the strength Timur's name to extend their rulership over all lands he once ruled."

# conversion_of_convenience_desc:0 "The fact that [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] does not follow the official state religion has long been a great thorn in the side of those that fight for the spirits and minds of the [Root.GetAdjective] people. Perhaps it is time for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to let the good of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] people go before personal matters of faith?"
 reform_into_iqta_title:0 "采用伊斯兰政体"
# reform_into_iqta_desc:0 "Kingship and governance can be many things and the traditions we rely on lie outside the mainstream of the Islamic world. By adopting the Iqta system we can assert our authority over the lands of the realm directly, with revenue rights given only to trusted Amirs."
 enforce_religion_muslim_title:0 "强制宗教统一"
# enforce_religion_muslim_desc:0 "We must not abide the heretics in our realm. A harsh set of laws designed to target any followers of the traditions of false Imams and priests will allow us to marginalize any heretical influence within our society."

# flavor_tur.107.t:0 "Muslim-Born Men Enroll as Janissaries"
# flavor_tur.107.d:0 "While the intention had originally been for the Janissaries to be raised only through the devshirme, the social status associated with being a Janissary together with a guaranteed state salary is very attractive for many of our subjects. As the Corps grows in size, we find ourselves unable to fill its ranks solely with devshirme recruits, and have consequently begun to allow Muslim-born men to buy their way into the Corps. As these outsiders have not spent their lives in our service, they are more difficult to train and discipline."

# flavor_tur.108.t:0 "The Lapse of the Devshirme"
# flavor_tur.108.d:0 "By the middle of the 17th century, the Devshirme had run its course in Ottoman history. The ümera class, in addition to being overpopulated relative to state offices available, now got its manpower from new sources, particularly Abkhazian, Circassian, and Georgian slaves. The Janissaries, too, had long since begun to recruit from the empire's Muslim population, rendering the Devshirme obsolete. Although occasional levies would still take place into the early years of the 18th century, by the 1650s the practice had for all intents and purposes come to an end."
# flavor_tur.108.a:0 "So be it."
# janissary_decadence.1.d.nosheikh:1 "Great commotion was abound in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] today as the Janissaries, long discontent with what they see as the misrule of the empire by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], rejected the bread given by [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and overturned their cauldrons in the central square. The Janissaries claim that [Root.Monarch.GetName] is a disgrace to the House of Osman, and that he aims to destroy the military strength of the empire.\nThe Janissaries have now moved quickly to seize control over the government and have secured the support of many of the other political groups of the capital. While [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is still alive [Root.Monarch.GetName] is no longer in control of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] empire."

# janissary_decadence.7.d:0 "As the House of Osman is highly revered, revolting troops are more likely to blame the ills of the state on the influence of advisors and favorites rather than the Sultan himself. The Janissaries are now demanding that we hand over several palace figures to them for execution, including numerous treasury officials blamed for paying them in impure coinage as well as the Chief Black Eunuch, a major intermediary between the Sultan and the world outside the palace."
# janissary_decadence.7.a:0 "We have no choice but to hand them over."
# janissary_decadence.7.b:0 "Reject these demands!"

# flavor_tim.0.d:0 "The aging ruler of the Timurid Empire, Shah Rukh, has been ill since the beginning of 1444. In his absence his wife, Goharshad, had taken over the daily rule of the empire but this sign of weakness has set wheels in motion among the princes that rule the Timurid provinces.\n\nIn western Iran the young prince Muhammad Baysonqor, an ambitious grandson, has started to accept taxes and tokens of loyalty from a much larger region than his assigned governorate. Having finally recovered and learned of this insolence Shah Rukh has now declared Muhammad Baysonqor a rebell and is moving to strike at him at first opportunity.\nIf a civil war among all sons and grandsons, like that at the end of Timurs life, is to be avoided Shah Rukh knows he must strike down any sign of rebellion harshly and quickly."

# flavor_tim.1.t:0 "Death of Shah Rukh"
# flavor_tim.1.d:0 "After a lifetime of war and iron fisted rule, Timur's heir and son, Shah Rukh, has finally passed on. His life's work has been to keep the empire his father built together, unifying it after Timur's death and then stamping out any rebellions against his own rule.\nShah Rukh brought peace to many parts of the empire and under his rule the arts and sciences have blossomed. During his last years he has been ill often, however, and his sons and cousins have used this time to prepare for the inevitable war of succession."

# flavor_daimyo.1.d:0 "With the Tosa province once again back under our direct rule we have been approached by some local Daimyo petitioning to take over the fiefs in the area on our behalf. The Chosokabe claim descent from the first emperor of China and have made themselves known as militarily strong retainers of their previous overlords. As retainers of the [Root.GetName] Shogunate they promise to be a loyal force for our interests in Shikoku."
# flavor_daimyo.1.a:0 "Let us empower the Chosokabe."
# flavor_daimyo.1.b:0 "We will keep it under our own control."
# flavor_daimyo.2.t:0 "Rise of the Later Hojo"
# flavor_daimyo.2.d:0 "While lacking prior connections to the region, the Hojo clan has quickly arisen to prominence in the Musashi province. Having consolidated a number of territories they have built a strong castle in Odawara as their capital. This is quite impressive but also treason against our local retainers in the province."
# flavor_daimyo.2.a:0 "It is time for the Hojo to Shine."
# flavor_daimyo.2.b:0 "Let us strike down these traitors."
# flavor_daimyo.3.t:0 "The Mori Clan"
# flavor_daimyo.3.d:0 "Descended from Oe Hiromoto, the Mori clan has quickly arisen as the leading clan of the Aki province. Through skilful maneuvering and military prowess Mori Motanari has defeated many local enemies and made a name for himself as an impressive general in his own right. At this point the Mori influence over the area has now grown past even our own and unless we act soon we will have to accept the fact that the Mori are now a faction in their own right."
# flavor_daimyo.3.a:0 "Aki is a Mori province."

# flavor_daimyo.4.t:0 "Shiba Yoshikado"
# flavor_daimyo.4.d:0 "While we are an old and honorable clan keeping together a domain as spread out as that of ours comes with problems. With the death of Shiba Yoshotoshi some retainers have chosen to support Yoshikado, a son adopted from a minor branch of the family at the request of the Shogunate over [Root.Monarch.GetName]. This places us in a precarious situation with [Root.Monarch.GetName] retaining control of part of the Shiba realm, while Yoshikado has the support of the nobles in [yoshikado_pretender_province.GetName]."
# flavor_daimyo.4.a:0 "Stay true to [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
# flavor_daimyo.4.b:0 "Support Yoshikado"
# flavor_daimyo.5.t:0 "Rightful Succession"
# flavor_daimyo.5.d:0 "The long standing lack of a true-born son for [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has meant that for many years his brother, Mochitomi, has been considered the natural successor. With the appointment of [Root.Heir.GetName] as the new heir apparent, Mochitomi and his son Masanaga have proved unwilling to let go of their position and influence. Together they have formed a faction with ties all the way up to the court of the [shogunate_clan.GetName] Shogunate."
# flavor_daimyo.5.a:0 "Side with [Root.Heir.GetName]."
# flavor_daimyo.5.b:0 "Support Mochitomi's claim."

# flavor_daimyo.6.d:0 "Having been unable to produce an heir of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own, many of our stronger vassals are expecting [Root.Monarch.GetName] to adopt a member of one of the leading families of the realm as [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] successor.\nThe branches of the Hosokawa family seem unable to line up behind a single candidate however, and whichever heir we appoint we seem likely to face the displeasure his opponents."
# flavor_daimyo.6.a:0 "I will name Sumitomo as the heir apparent."
# flavor_daimyo.6.b:0 "Sumiyuki of the Kujo would be best."
# flavor_daimyo.6.c:0 "Takakuni is a worthy successor."
# flavor_daimyo.7.t:0 "Rise of the Miyoshi Family"
# flavor_daimyo.7.d:0 "The Miyoshi Family of Awa has been growing increasingly influential both by providing valuable services to our clan and by making use of the chaotic lawlessness that still exist in many parts of the country. Using the alliances they have forged with many of our retainers the Miyoshi family, under Nagayoshi’s leadership, is now attempting to make a bid to control our clan."
# flavor_daimyo.7.a:0 "Rebel Scum!"
# flavor_daimyo.7.b:0 "It is time to make room for a man of ability."
# flavor_daimyo.8.t:0 "The Ogigayatsu"
# flavor_daimyo.8.d:0 "As our influence grows so has that of the minor branches of family. The Ogigayatsu branch of the Uesugi has been increasing their influence in Kanto, growing more and more independent-minded with each passing year. If we do not act soon we may find ourselves with very limited influence over the provinces held by our kinsmen."
# flavor_daimyo.8.a:0 "Death to all traitors!"
# flavor_daimyo.8.b:0 "We must keep the family together."
# flavor_daimyo.9.t:0 "Restoration of the Akamatsu Clan"
# flavor_daimyo.9.d:0 "In the aftermath of the assassination of Shogun Ashikaga Yoshinori in 1441 the Akamatsu clan was disgraced and stripped of their fief in Harima and handed over to the Yamana. Recently however the fief has once again returned to our hands and the Akamatsu have petitioned to be granted the right to return to Harima."
# flavor_daimyo.9.a:0 "The Akamatsu have redeemed themselves."
# flavor_daimyo.9.b:0 "We could never trust these traitors."
# flavor_daimyo.10.t:0 "The Meireki Conflagration"
# flavor_daimyo.10.d:0 "It is not hard to see how this unusually dry year left the city of [1028.GetCapitalName] vulnerable to fires. Few would have guessed however that an unnoticed spark in a wooden temple would be the start of an all consuming fire. In three days the fire has reduced our once great city to cinders, claiming over 100 000 lives.\nIt now falls on us to rebuild and restore what once was a great city and perhaps to create a more fire-proof settlement for future generations."
# flavor_daimyo.10.a:0 "We need large boulevards and dedicated fire brigades."
# flavor_daimyo.10.b:0 "We must focus on restoring the homes of our poor citizens."
# flavor_daimyo.10.c:0 "Fires and Quarrels are the Flowers of Edo."

# flavor_daimyo.11.t:0 "Nankai Tsunami"
# flavor_daimyo.11.d:0 "A gigantic wave has our southern coastline, washing away houses and destroying castles, temples and roads. The effects of this disaster are felt along the entire Nankaido area and will likely have great effects on the region for years to come.

# flavor_daimyo.13.d:0 "For two weeks now cinders and ash have been raining from the skies around Mount Fuji.

# flavor_daimyo.15.t:0 "Shimabara Rebellion"
# flavor_daimyo.15.d:0 "After a period of widespread famine the peasants of the Shimabara peninsula have taken up arms against their local magistrate. Citing harsh taxation and oppression they have been joined by many wandering Ronin from the countryside, who are former servants of local families. It is also rumored that local Christian europeans are supporting the rebels who are now besieging the local castles."
# flavor_daimyo.15.a:1 "Crush them."
# flavor_daimyo.16.t:0 "The Ako Vendetta"
# flavor_daimyo.16.d:0 "Some time back one of our retainers, Asano Naganori, was forced to commit Seppuku after attacking a rival, Kira Yoshinaka, within the walls of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. Breaching the peace of our capital is a serious offense and few thought much more would come of it.\nYesterday, however, it seems forty seven sworn men, former Samurai of the dead Asano, now leaderless Ronin, breached Kira's mansion. Fighting their way through his defenders they finally avenged their fallen master, killing Kira and taking his head with them to Asanos grave.\nWhile a great feat there can be no doubt that these men have broken the laws of our [Root.GovernmentName] and that they deserve to be imprisoned and executed. And yet the people seem to admire and idolize these men."

# flavor_daimyo.16.b:0 "Law and order must rule, let us execute these ronin."
# flavor_daimyo.17.t:0 "The rise of the Yamana"
# flavor_daimyo.17.d:0 "Few have profited more than us from the fall of the Akamatsu clan after their assassination of Shogun Ashikaga Yoshinori. As the Akamatsu were stripped of their important lands and belongings many of them were given to reward our loyalty, and as a sign that we have atoned for the rebellion of 1391. This sudden rise to power has made some suspicious however. The Hosokawa especially view our influence as troubling and might well act to limit our influence in the future."
# flavor_daimyo.17.a:0 "Let us bide our time and build our power to challenge the Hosokawa in the future."
# flavor_daimyo.17.b:0 "Let us forge alliances and pacts to contain the Hosokawa influence."
# flavor_daimyo.18.t:0 "Kyoto of the West"
# flavor_daimyo.18.d:0 "In this time of war and unrest many fear for their safety in the Imperial court of Kyoto. Many influential nobles, retainers, scholars and artisans are now turning away from the great city, looking to the provinces for safety.\nFor a distant clan such as ours this is an opportunity in disguise. If we can attract these men of quality to our court in Yamaguchi we could aspire to be a new Kyoto in the west. For anyone to take such a claim seriously we would have to invest greatly in the growth of our city, its castle and its infrastructure. Renovations that would come at a high price…"
# flavor_daimyo.18.a:0 "A nice dream, but an expensive one."
# flavor_daimyo.18.b:0 "Yamaguchi shall be like no city before it."
# flavor_daimyo.19.t:0 "Merchant of Sakai"
# flavor_daimyo.19.d:0 "Tired of the lawlessness that prevails in the Japanese lands in the current era the Merchant Council in the city of Sakai has taken matters in their own hands, creating a small autonomous community of their own. They have now approached the court of [Root.Monarch.GetName] asking for our protection and continued autonomy to pursue their own mercantile goals."
# flavor_daimyo.19.a:0 "Let us support Sakai."
# flavor_daimyo.19.b:0 "Confiscate their properties."
# flavor_daimyo.20.t:0 "Revolt of Harunobu"
# flavor_daimyo.20.d:0 "A dynamic son of our ruler, Harunobu, has surprisingly taken up arms against his father for the leadership of our clan. He has quickly gained the support of many of our retainers who recognize a brilliant leader in the man. Can this be the man who will lead the Takeda to greatness or is it just a disloyal son, acting out against his father?"
# flavor_daimyo.20.a:0 "We must look to Harunobu for leadership."
# flavor_daimyo.20.b:0 "Crush him."
# flavor_daimyo.21.t:0 "The Kyotoku Incident"
# flavor_daimyo.21.d:0 "For decades our clan has been the most powerful in Kanto and at odds with the Kamakura Kubo, a member of the Ashikaga Clan given the mission to control the Kanto region. Eager to gain power and influence for his own family the Kubo has also often been in conflict with his kinsmen in Kyoto, and as recently as 1439 the Shogunate deposed the last Kubo by force of arms.\nAs of [GetYear] a new Kubo has taken up office in Kamakura. The newcomer, Shigeuji, has wasted no time to act against our interests and recently killed our deputy Uesugi Noritada.\nThis is a grave affront to our clan and one that the Shogunate could never stand behind."
# flavor_daimyo.21.a:0 "The days of the Kubo are numbered!"
# flavor_daimyo.21.b:0 "We must not disturb the peace."
# flavor_daimyo.22.t:0 "Azuchi Castle"
# flavor_daimyo.22.d:0 "Power is worth nothing if it is not visible. While we have secured control over the Shogunate we must still impress on the many servants of the Empire that all power lies with the [Root.GetName] Clan. Let us build a great castle close to the court as a constant reminder of what the source of our power is. It must be higher and stronger than any castle before it and be built to make good use of the modern arms that warfare has brought this country. The Azuchi castle will be a symbol of our power, and a tool to control central Japan for our family."
# flavor_daimyo.22.a:0 "A marvelous project!"
# flavor_daimyo.22.b:0 "We have no time for such vanities."
# flavor_daimyo.23.t:0 "Nobunagas Ambition"
# flavor_daimyo.23.d:0 "The Oda clan is divided in factions and held back by old loyalties. A young scion of our family, Nobunaga, has emerged victorious from a series of succession disputes in Owari. Willing to forego principles for his greater ambitions Nobunaga seems like an unstoppable force both within our clan and in his dealings with other families.\nOnly time can tell where this can bring the Oda."
# flavor_daimyo.23.a:0 "Tenka Fubu."
# flavor_daimyo.24.t:0 "Hideyoshi"
# flavor_daimyo.24.d:0 "A remarkable man has risen from among our Ashigaru to earn the right to be sandal-bearer of our great Lord [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Though secretive of his past he seems to be of no lineage to speak of and come from humble origins.\nNonetheless Hideyoshi is one of our greatest generals and a power within our realm. In this era of self-made strong men he seems to embody the ideal warrior, loyal, clever and able."
# flavor_daimyo.24.a:0 "We have great need of such generals."
# flavor_daimyo.24.b:0 "A skilled negotiator for our clan."
# flavor_daimyo.25.t:0 "Economic Reforms of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
# flavor_daimyo.25.d:0 "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has always taken a great interest in the economy of his realm. Managing everything from sweeping overall policies to minor day to day thing in his personal domain he has no interest in perpetuating the inefficient, if traditional, customs and habits of our ancestors.\nRecently he has set out on a number of reforms to lessen the power of the trade guilds, prohibiting monopolies, increasing trade invovlement and protecting the roads under our control."
# flavor_daimyo.25.a:0 "Excellent."
# flavor_daimyo.26.t:0 "The Great Days of Chuzan"
# flavor_daimyo.26.d:0 "Over time it has become evident to all that it is the economic and political prowess of [Root.Monarch.GetName] that has made our realm blossom. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] reorganization of the kingdom administration, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hard work to attract foreign traders, and the creation of a new bureaucracy for our unified kingdom has allowed [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to expand our capital and oversee the construction of temples, palaces and monuments."

# trs_mawarannahr_desc:0 "Transoxiana, the land beyond the Amu Darya, or Oxus, has been known since the days of the great Iskandar of Macedon as the end of Persian culture. Our lands are where Iran ends and Turan starts, a realm of great cities, but also dominated by Turko-Mongol tribes.\nIn more recent times Transoxiana was the starting point for Timur Lenk's Empire and it remains the base for many of the clans that supported his bid for power. As Timur has shown we could do great things as long as we keep them united."
# trs_threshold_of_paradise:0 "Threshold of Paradise"
# trs_threshold_of_paradise_desc:0 "While he was far from the first conqueror to come to Transoxiana, Timur made the region the center of his Empire and he brought treasures, artists, builders and artisans from the entire world to his great capital in Samarkand. We must strive to uphold this legacy, and continue to embellish this foremost jewel among cities. From the courts in Castile to the palaces in Beijing everyone shall covet the gilded city on the Silk Road."

Ever since the days of Timur, young princes, uncles and cousins have plotted against one another for the right to rule this region. When one of our princes reach adulthood and manages to take on the reins of power, we can be sure that they are, if nothing else, quite adept at espionage and politics.\nIf our realm is to ever be free of this poisonous atmosphere we must put an end to such infighting, striving to outsmart the lesser scions of the family once and for all."

From east to west traders know of the reputation of Bukhara and Samarkand, and are willing to cross the deserts of the Tarim Basin and Iran or the great steppes to the north, to be able to sell their wares here, bringing home our silk, paper and whichever exotic goods they can find here to their homelands.\nOur wealth depends on keeping the peace. Without Timur, and Genghis Khan before him, many find this too dangerous to undertake.

They have made up the military foundation of a number of states such as those of the Ilkhanate, Seljuks or more recently the Timurids. Ajam sits at the very center of the greater Turko-Persian region, and for this reason it was here that the Ilkhans once constructed their capital at Sultaniyya. Today the Ilkhans are long gone but their monuments and their traditions remain, in Sultaniyya their mausoleum still bear witness to the empire that once was.\nIf we want to dominate this region we must embrace the Ilkhanate ideals of kingship, and win the loyalty of the Turkic warriors that still dwell here."

On the outskirts of the great settlements, however, a great number of groups of nomads and semi-nomads traverse and populate the region, Arabs, Turkomans, Baluch, Kalaj and Bedouin. Some have been here for centuries, others arrived more recently, all of them have traditionally been left mostly to their own devices.

The key to survival in a dangerous world is not to surrender as soon as we are threatened, but it is also not to go looking for a fight that we don’t yet know who will win. As new claimants to supremacy in Persia come and go we will carefully consider our options. Our people will be here long after any newcomers are gone, regardless of if they win or lose their petty conflicts."

Instead she found the secret of wine and in little time it spread from the royal court.\nWine has been produced and consumed in Persia for millennia, but none can compete with those made from the excellent grapes cultivated on the terraced slopes of the Zagros mountains in Fars. The reputation of Shirazi wine has spread far beyond the borders and is greatly in demand even in India and Europe.\nWe must expand our irrigation system and do what we can to increase our wine production, while marketing our highly sought after goods on foreign markets."

The Qashqai and other groups have often been at odds with the city dwellers, leading to expensive conflicts between the two that does not benefit the realm.\nWe must integrate the Qashqai and give them place in our cities while guaranteeing their rights to use land for grazing.

People who have found themselves on the losing side of wars, who have been cleared away to make way for irrigation or who have been deemed to unruly to remain when central power was expanded.\nWe should open our arms to these people and allow them to settle as new tribes in our mountains.

Between our veneration of local shrines, the emamzadas (descendants of the Imams) and the prevalence of syncretic sects such as Yarsanism, would like strike the most learned of the Ulema as quite unsettling.

Dynasty of Kublai Khan, patronizing scholarship and reviving the Imperial Examination system that suffered under Mongol rule. Across the Gobi desert, in outer §YMongolia§!, lies the few remnants of Kublai's realm, weak and divided.\n\nNews from the north, however, speak of a new leader who has united the Nomad hordes. §YEsen§! of the §YChoros§! clan have united the §YOirats§! and Mongols and might yet turn his greedy eyes on the Middle Kingdom."

The descendants of Genghis and Kublai Khan are presently rulers of little more than a few disparate Mongolian tribes, and have been subdued by a foreign Khan of much less worthy descent.\n\nWhat the future has in store for the once great §YMongolia§! is far from clear.

# string_start_philippines:0 "In [GetYear] the Philippine islands are home to a number of small seafaring city states. The islands have always been distant enough to preserve their autonomy even in the face of strong hegemons like the former Srivijaya empire or the muslim Sultanates of §YBrunei§! and §YMalacca§!.\n\nInstead the archipelago has developed into a microcosm of indianized, sinophile and islamicized kingdoms, each with their own character and background.\n\nIn the north, on the island of Luzon, the city states of §YPangasinan§! and §YTondo§! thrive on the trade with the §YEmpire of China§!. Their status as tributaries allows them to gather Chinese goods for resale to the other islands. To this end the small Islamic city state of §YMaynila§!, has entered into close cooperation with Tondo. The latter acts as a port towards the Chinese while the former is the central point for the spreading of Chinese goods to the other islands.\n\nFurther south, in the Visayan archipelago, a number of Hindu settlements are competing to control the trade routes. The island kingdom of §YCebu§! is perhaps the oldest state in the region. The Cebu rulers claim the legacy of a prince of the Indian §YChola§! Empire. Many of the other states have entered into the federation of §YMadyas§!, a loose organization where each member takes turns to assume leadership over the others.\n\nWhile the old Hindu Rajahnate of §YButuan§! has traditionally held the upper hand in the far south it has recently had increasing competition from the Muslim oriented states of §YMaguindanao§! and §YSulu§!. Sulu has all but entered the sphere of the Muslim Sultanate of Brunei while Maguindanao has seen the royal family increasingly embracing islamic traditions over their traditional animist religion.\n\nSome would say that the divided nature of this rich archipelago at the turn of [GetYear] makes it vulnerable.

Posing as local magistrates of powerful temples, or of the Daimyo, clans such as §YOda§!, §YTsutsui§! and §YTokugawa§! have begun to build small but powerful realms in their local areas.\n\nThe growing power of the §YHosokawa§! and §YYamana§! clans, two clans that between them control one third of Japan, threaten to make the Shogunate inconsequential.

Shoguns have placed Eastern Japan under one of their own family members, the Kamakura Kubo. The Kamakura Kubo however has often sought to act independently of the Shoguns' in Kyoto, using his office to build a personal power base in eastern Japan.\n\nAs the most influential of the eastern Daimyo, the §YUesugi§! have often tried to limit the ambitions of the Kamakura Kubo. Claiming to take the side of the Ashikaga Shogun against his kin in the east. Through these conflicts it has become clear that many of the lords of the east, and the Uesugi in particular, will need to rely on their own strength to defend their interests.\n\nAt the end of [GetYear] the east is quiet but volatile. The Uesugi remain the strongest faction in the region, but this strength is only backed up by their own capability to defend themselves.

Should they choose to pursue his careful policies of diplomatic marriages and patient inheritance planning, the Habsburgs may well build up a position of power unlike that of any family among the kings of Europe.

By playing off the English and French against each other the Dukes have for a long time been practically independent. De jure however the Dukes remain both subjects to France and to the Holy Roman Empire. With the Hundred Years War nearing, what looks like, its conclusion, the future of the Duchy seems uncertain. If it continues its meteoric rise Burgundy could be the embryo of a new kingdom. A strong state in the middle of Western Europe. But the dukes have also gained many enemies in this short time.

These slaves are then trained as soldiers or stewards, who all swear allegiance to their buyer, or ‘foster-father’. The amirs in turn put their household to use in the service of the sultans. When the time for succession comes it is in practice the will of these powerful men that determines which amir will become the next sultan. This system ensures that the sultanate is never short of elite warriors, so long as the route to import more slaves from the Black Sea lies open. However, as a governing system it has more than once lead to damaging conflicts and paralyzing factionalism.\n\nThe future looks bright for the Mamluk Sultanate however, as the death of Timur has removed the greatest threat in the region, with the once expansive §YTimurid§!
