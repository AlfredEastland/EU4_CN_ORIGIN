In an increasingly interconnected world acquiring anything, including coffee is no longer quite as hard as it once was. As a result, coffeehouses are increasingly being established in Europe and the exotic beans are in increasing demand."

Sarala Das' original work is also exclusively in Oriya and other poets have now begun to take up this practice."

Babur took care to train these troops to achieve better results and unlike the Mughal cavalry arm the recruitment, training and organization of musketmen would be kept under his direct control. Whether Babur's great success at Panipat was due to the use of fire arms or not the use of musketmen became increasingly commonplace in Indian armies after Babur's invasion."

Students were chosen from among the most promising devshirme recruits (conscripted Christian youths mostly from the Balkans), and were trained in the Islamic faith, the sciences, and the military arts. They were expected to develop competency in the three languages of Turkish, Arabic, and Persian. This prepared them to serve in the Sultan's household, from which they could hope to graduate as government administrators with the rank of bey or pasha. The staffing of government posts with devshirme recruits trained in the palace school and loyal to the sultan formed the backbone of the Ottoman system of patrimonial rule throughout the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries."

Near the end of his reign he sought to reduce the power of the ulema by rerouting revenues from the foundations (waqf) which supported them to the timar system instead, further strengthening the Ottoman army. This move, illegal under Islamic Law, caused widespread resentment and was quickly reversed by his son Bayezid upon Mehmed's death in 1481."

The highly unorthodox, quasi-Shiite Bektashi order has maintained a close relationship with the Janissaries since the 15th century, contributing to their unique culture.

It seems the Jesuits are tolerating a very high degree of non-Christian rituals among the supposedly converted Chinese. The other orders are abhorred by the Jesuit conduct and by their supposedly Christian converts and have urged us to make a clear statement that the Chinese Ancestor rites have no place among Christians and that anyone who wishes to join our Church must abandon such things."

# muslim_piety.1.t:1 "Spread of Extreme Practices in [spread_of_extreme_practices_province.GetAreaName]"
# muslim_piety.1.d:1 "The late Middle Ages saw the emergence of several new forms of Islamic mysticism, one of the most controversial being a brand of Sufi dervishes known as the 'renunciationists'. These men sought to separate themselves entirely from normal society, shaving all body hair down to their eyebrows and publicly breaking the rules of the Sharia in order to demonstrate their unique relationship with God, all while wandering from town to town begging for alms. Our religious scholars are calling for their persecution, arguing that the uneducated populace's tendency to view them with awe will lead them away from the true faith."

# muslim_piety.1.b:1 "Leave them be."
# muslim_piety.2.t:1 "Returning Scholars"
# muslim_piety.2.d:1 "Particularly in the aftermath of the Mongol conquests of the thirteenth century, Egypt and Syria emerged as the foremost centers of scholarly learning in the Muslim world. Sunni scholars of every persuasion flocked to Damascus and Cairo to learn from the most renowned teachers of science, theology, and above all law, while Shi'ites travelled to Jabal Amil in Lebanon to meet with the scholars of orthodox Twelver Shi'ism. Many students from our lands, having completed their educational pilgrimage, are now returning home and hoping to implement legalistic Islam in our [Root.GovernmentName] just as they learned it in the heartlands of Islam."
# muslim_piety.2.a:1 "They will make a welcome addition to our country."
# muslim_piety.2.b:1 "Contact with the divine is not about studying books."
# muslim_piety.3.t:1 "Sufi Organizations Rally Support"
# muslim_piety.3.d:1 "During the early modern period popular forms of Sufi worship became extremely widespread in the Muslim world. Seeing the weakened state of our armies, the sheikh of a major order has begun urging his followers to take up arms in support of us against our enemies."
# muslim_piety.3.a:1 "We cannot rely on mystics for support!"
# muslim_piety.3.b:1 "Let us welcome these warriors of faith."
# muslim_piety.4.t:1 "Religious Harmony"
# muslim_piety.4.d:1 "Just as many members of the Ulema have developed Sufi leanings, many of our Sufi orders have likewise come to extol the virtue of a pious life lived in accordance with the Sharia. Despite disapproving voices on both extremes, we have managed to strike a balance between mysticism and legalism. Our realm is currently enjoying the fruits of moderation and tolerance of differing religious practices."
# muslim_piety.4.a:1 "God is good."
# muslim_piety.5.t:1 "Debate over the Philosophy of Ibn Arabi"
# muslim_piety.5.d:1 "Ibn Arabi was an Andalusian scholar and mystic, regarded by many Sufis as the foremost spiritual master. His pantheistic philosophy of the 'unity of being' viewed all of creation as a manifestation of God, and invited worshippers to see divine beauty in all aspects of life, not merely in the traditional rituals of Islam. Ever since, debates have raged on over the compatibility of his philosophy with scholarly interpretations of Islam, with some going so far as to label him an unbeliever. For many Sufis, on the other hand, Ibn Arabi's philosophy became the foundational principle of their religious practice. Now we too are being asked to take sides."
# muslim_piety.5.a:1 "Deny the unity of being."
# muslim_piety.5.b:1 "Support the unity of being."
# muslim_piety.6.t:1 "Dhimmi Building Restrictions"
# muslim_piety.6.d:1 "Under Islamic Law, non-Muslims faced a number of restrictions on the construction of new buildings in urban centers: their houses were not to be taller than those of the Muslims, and they were not permitted to construct new centers of worship, only to maintain those which already existed. In practice, these rules often went unenforced, but as our realm shifts further toward a legalistic interpretation of Islam, key members of the Ulema are beginning to call for their stricter implementation."
# muslim_piety.6.a:1 "Enforce the letter of the law."
# muslim_piety.6.b:1 "Leave them to do as they please."
# muslim_piety.7.t:1 "Dhimmis Flout Building Restrictions"
# muslim_piety.7.d:1 "Despite being officially prohibited from constructing houses of worship and tall buildings, the dhimmis in several provinces of our realm are openly disobeying the laws, and many of our qadis are too lax to respond, either because they see no harm in it or because of the hefty bribes they can earn for turning a blind eye."
# muslim_piety.7.a:1 "Increase enforcement efforts."
# muslim_piety.7.b:1 "Let the laws go unenforced."
# muslim_piety.8.t:1 "Enjoining Right and Forbidding Wrong"
# muslim_piety.8.d:1 "Muslims are encouraged in the Qur'an to take an active role in their community in order to “enjoin right and forbid wrong.” While this command has been interpreted in many ways by Muslim scholars, it was sometimes used by reformist groups to justify the forceful spread of more extreme views. A group of charismatic mosque preachers in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] have begun calling for the end of unorthodox religious practices and are inciting the populace against the Sufis, leading to violence and street battles."
# muslim_piety.8.a:1 "Stamp down on the movement."
# muslim_piety.8.b:1 "Offer them our support."
# muslim_piety.9.t:1 "Debate over Sufi Practices"
# muslim_piety.9.d:1 "Muslim scholars were not united on the question of the permissibility of Sufism. While most appreciated the heightened levels of religious devotion it inspired among the general population, some disapproved of how certain Sufis expressed their faith. Poetry and song about wine and illicit love, as well as communal dancing and veneration for the tombs of those regarded as saints, could at times provoke opposition from more hardline elements of the Ulema."
# muslim_piety.9.a:1 "Support the hardliners."
# muslim_piety.9.b:1 "Support the moderates."
# muslim_piety.10.t:1 "Purification of Tax Laws"
# muslim_piety.10.d:1 "Ensuring that the realm's laws operate in accordance with the sacred Sharia requires us to occasionally re-examine our tax-collection practices, and to strive to align them as closely as possible with the legal positions held by the great lawmakers of our [Root.GetReligiousSchool] school. This means eliminating the customary taxes which have accumulated over the years, and taking only what is permitted by the Sharia."
# muslim_piety.10.a:1 "The peasantry must be free from unlawful exactions."
# muslim_piety.10.b:1 "Reject the proposal."
# muslim_piety.11.t:1 "Mystics and Storytellers"
# muslim_piety.11.d:1 "Many among the Ulema would question the great influence that storytellers have over the life of common men. The traditional hero stories of our people are centuries old but they risk making a cult out of seriously distorted fates of historical figures. A prominent cleric in [storytellerprovince.GetAreaName] have taken a strong stand against the storytellers of the realm, and cautions that religious scholars of the past have warned that obsessive listening to stories could lead to false worship."
# muslim_piety.11.a:1 "We must ban offensive stories from the realm."
# muslim_piety.11.b:1 "There is nothing wrong in idealizing our ancestors."
# muslim_piety.12.t:1 "Trade Guilds and Fraternities"
# muslim_piety.12.d:1 "Guilds and fraternities are a constant factor in the public life of the [Root.GovernmentName], in many ways these are small communities within the community, with their own rules, customs and even laws. It is also very common for these associations to indulge in mystic traditions, sufism and often unorthodox adaption of the Sharia. Something that sometimes makes it hard for the laws of the Ulema to penetrate the urban milieu.\nAn artisan in [fraternity_province.GetName] has reached out to the state, warning us of a local guildsman with a great influence on local affairs. Anyone wishing to take up a craft in the city is currently required to be approved by this man and then swear an oath of allegiance."
# muslim_piety.12.a:1 "This is unacceptable."
# muslim_piety.12.b:1 "Let us not interfere with the guilds."
# muslim_piety.13.t:1 "Social Dissent and Popular Sufism"
# muslim_piety.13.d:1 "The great stress that our government has placed on Legalism and the limiting of Mysticism in our society has had the effect of closely associating Sufism with resistance to central rule. In times of social distress many now look to the Mystical orders for spiritual guidance as an alternative to the highly legalistic Ulema and its [Root.GovernmentName] ally.\nAs tensions flare in [popular_sufism_province.GetName] an influential Sufi Master declared his support for [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], potentially calming the situation."
# muslim_piety.13.a:1 "We cannot accept the support of a Mystic."
# muslim_piety.13.b:1 "God is good."
# muslim_piety.14.t:1 "Coffee and Tobacco"
# muslim_piety.14.d:1 "While they are quite new to our society the use of stimulants such as Coffee and Tobacco has spread quickly, with coffee houses now a common feature from [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to [coffee_province.GetAreaName]. The popularity is especially marked among the Sufi orders. The novelty of these substances means that the religious establishment is divided on their proper use.\nMany strict legalists wants us to limit their use while others argue for caution, as both Coffee and Tobacco are very popular in our state. The local governor of [coffee_province.GetName] have now turned to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] wanting to close down the local coffee houses that he believes have become meeting places for dissidents."
# muslim_piety.14.a:1 "Let us impose Restrictions."
# muslim_piety.14.b:1 "Let them have their coffee."
# muslim_piety.15.t:1 "Sufi Orders growing in popularity in [new_province.GetName]"
# muslim_piety.15.d:1 "Some of the more prevalent Sufi orders in [Root.GetName] have quickly started to establish themselves in the newly acquired [new_province.GetName] province. While the locals seem somewhat hesitant about [Root.GetAdjective] rule they have embraced the orders and this has greatly eased the integration of the province into our [Root.GovernmentName]."
# muslim_piety.15.a:1 "Strengthen the legal establishment instead."
# muslim_piety.15.b:1 "This is excellent."
# muslim_piety.16.t:1 "Disregard of the Sharia?"
# muslim_piety.16.d:1 "The learned Ulema complain over the widespread flouting of Sharia rules in our [Root.GovernmentName]. They demand that we reduce the influence of Mystic orders and heterodoxy in the country. Failing to comply could see us risking losing their support and many of these valuable legal scholars might even leave for other courts."
# muslim_piety.16.a:1 "Let us follow their recommendations."
# muslim_piety.16.b:1 "We cannot give in to such threats."
# muslim_piety.20.t:1 "A New [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
# muslim_piety.20.d:1 "Our nation has sorely lacked a firm guiding hand under the rule of [Root.Heir.GetName], a timid child, ill-prepared to face the dangers of the world. Fortunately for us all, one of [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] uncles, and close advisors has decided to act. The child is now safely locked away where [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] can do no more harm. The advisor has been proclaimed our new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], and has sworn to provide our nation with the strong leadership it so desperately needs."

They are following a wicked faith and will most likely perish in the colonies.\nStill they have managed to gain the support of many of our settlers and have made a new home for themselves in this faraway land."

Most joined the Janissaries, an infantry standing army trained under strict discipline, while those who displayed particular leadership and intellectual ability were enrolled directly into the sultan's household as pages, where they were educated and, if successful, could be promoted to the highest ranks of the Ottoman military-administrative elite. With their livelihood dependent upon the ruler, these slaves, known as kul, showed intense loyalty and were critical for the Ottoman dynasty's establishment of centralized control over the empire."
