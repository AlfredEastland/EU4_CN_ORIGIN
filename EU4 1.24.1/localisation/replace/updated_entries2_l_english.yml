# avlita_port_desc:0 "Founded in the year 1425 on the Chernaya River, Avlita was the only trade port of Theodoro. While it was the only port, it caused constant strife with the Genoese colonies to the south over access to the coasts and the trade that went through the Crimean harbors."
# mother_of_russian_cities_desc:0 "Historically Kiev was the center of Rus' before the Mongol invasion. Many other Russian states attempted to fill the void after Kiev's fall: Moscow, Tver, Novgorod... But none of them could match Kiev's former glory.\nUnlike these northern upstarts, however, we are true heirs of the Kievan legacy, our people walk the same land as our Kievan ancestors and our capital aspires to the same greatness. Our claims must be respected!"
# desc_pulicat_booming:0 "Pulicat is ideally situated to be the primary port for all imports to the great city of Vijayanagar. As the capital grows so does its port and due to a fortunate string of events the trade here is booming right now. For the moment this is the most attractive port of the Indian Ocean."
# flavor_vij.12.d:0 "Since the foundation of our empire a steady stream of Telugu settlers have migrated south into our lands from Telingana in the north. We have so far graciously provided them with land to develop in the sparsely populated parts our empire and built water tanks to help their settlements grow. This way we have gained a healthy and loyal source of manpower for our armies.\nLately, however, these settlers (known as Vadugans by the Tamils) have started to spread even further south into the Tamil speaking areas. Tamil farming communities have raised their voices to allow them to stop the Telugu settlers moving into their lands."
# flavor_vij.13.d:0 "The autonomous nature of our Tamil possessions has been the perfect environment to build a power base for a local strongman.\nThe man in question, known as Chellappa, has requested to be allowed to serve as a general and seems content to act within the internal structure of our empire. It is, however, generally assumed that a man as ambitious as him must have his eyes set on much higher goals than a position in the army. While it is easy to deny him the honor he seeks and try to isolate him politically we run the risk of distancing ourselves of someone in control over much of our economic heartland.\nOn the other hand perhaps it would be most prudent to strike at him now instead of prolonging a conflict that many feel will be inevitable."
# flavor_vij.18.d:0 "Perhaps the greatest temple of all in our lands, the great temple of Venkateshwara and the connected temple city of Tirupati has increasingly come to be connected with the rulers of our state. Over the years it has grown from a major pilgrimage to one of the great temple cities in India. The city is supported by the donations of countless treasures as well as over 40 villages providing it with food and income.\nWe should, however, not be content with this. By increasing our support, providing it with even more villages and donations, we could ensure that it becomes the greatest temple city in all of Southern India. May Tirupati prosper for as long as our empire grows!"
# flavor_mor.4.d:0 "Fulfilling a long standing legend, the preserved body of Idris II was found in one of the mosques of Fez a few years ago. Ever since this event the Idrisid sharifs have been the centre of a growing a cult in Fez and in our kingdom in general.\nThis devout cult seems destined to lift the hearts our population after the harsh period we have left behind us. There is, however, always a risk with passionate popular movements like this one, it wouldn't do for them to forget who wields the temporal power."
# flavor_mor.5.d:0 "In all but name Morocco has not one but two royal dynasties. Since twenty years past almost all power formally held by the Marinid dynasty has in fact been wielded by their formidable Wattasid vizier Abu Zakariya Yahya.\nInsanely popular after his victory over the Portuguese in 1437 and his patronization of the Idrisid cult in Fez, Abu Zakariya Yahya has ensured that the royal bureaucracy is both well functioning and imbued with Wattasid family members. As the Wattasids are related to the Marinid rulers this is in itself perhaps not a worrying development. Now that Abu Zakariya Yahya lies on his deathbed, however, we cannot but wonder what the future will bring. The great man has seemingly left nothing to chance and has already arranged for his cousin to succeed him as Vizier but what remains unclear is what the Wattasid family will do in the future with the network Yahya has built them."
# flavor_mor.7.d:0 "In what was seen as a sudden betrayal of our Wattasid viziers our Sultan has had all the Wattasids he could find rounded up and executed. The popularity of the Wattasid family, however, means that this has been a very unpopular move.\nAs $MONARCH$ appointed a new, non Wattasid, vizier to serve him yesterday riots broke out and it is rumored that somewhere two Wattasid brothers remain hidden to take control over this revolt, determined to avenge their family."
# flavor_mal.4.d:0 "Having adopted a less violent approach, Portuguese traders have become an increasingly common sight along our western coasts. In many ways this is a boon to our state as it has given us much easier access to horses for our armies and a way to procure valuable goods from the many exotic ports frequented by Portuguese merchants. For gold or slaves there is not much the Portuguese wouldn't sell us and our merchant caste, the Wangara, is thriving due to this new partnership.\nThere is, however, a slight worry about this development in some camps, the amount of slaves to a horse seem to keep increasing by the day and while our own transoceanic ventures haven't gone so well it would seem less than prudent to rely entirely on these foreign merchants as they surely can't have our best interests at heart."
# flavor_mal.6.d:0 "While our kingdom is Islamic in name the old religion of our forefathers is still very much a force to be reckoned with. Islam has, however, been gaining more ground lately among the aristocracy and wandering marabouts have also become an increasingly common sight even in the farthest corners of our lands.\nIn the past our predecessors have all avoided trying to be too forceful about converting their subjects but if we wish we could probably make use of these recent developments to encourage the spread of the true faith."
# flavor_eth.12.d:0 "We have received a letter from the Ethiopian Emperor today. The message is a detailed account of the many perceived misdeeds of our Sultanate against the Copts that reside within our borders.\nThere is likely little reason for concern, however, as the patriarch of both the Egyptian and Ethiopian Copts is our hostage. It seems very unlikely that an Ethiopian monarch would risk the safety of his patriarch over a matter such as this."
# flavor_eth.19.d:0 "One of the greatest strengths of the Ethiopian church is the great number of successful monasteries that dot the landscape of our state. The Monastic orders have contributed to the success of our state by founding new monasteries in newly conquered areas and by spreading the word of the true faith there. The monasteries of Ethiopia are also the source of the education of the Ethiopian clergy, its nobility and its administrators and as such have contributed greatly to the revitalization of the Ethiopian church in the years past.\nThe other side of this coin, however, is that the monasteries and the orders that run them have grown both rich and autonomous."
# flavor_eth.20.d:0 "The dependency of the Ethiopian church on the Patriarchate of Alexandria has always been a liability for our country. Perhaps there was once a practical need of bishops, clergy and spiritual guidance from abroad. The expansion of the Ethiopian church over the last two centuries, however, means that our kingdom is now already training its own clergymen and there is a strong religious infrastructure in the form of churches and monasteries throughout or lands.\nWith the Egyptian Patriarchate held hostage by Muslim conquerors we often have to wait a long time between the death of one bishop and the appointment of the next. It would be far more efficient to appoint our religious leadership from the ranks of our own clergy."
# flavor_bng.4.d:0 "Bengal is famed for its fertile soil and rich harvests. The great delta of the Ganges is, however, still covered by thick jungles and swamps. The clearing of land to allow our ever-growing population some room to spread is a process that has been going on slowly but steadily for longer than anyone can remember.\nRecently a number of holy men, many of them Sufis have begun to get involved in this process. These holy men have mobilized the hearts of our people and the process of land reclamation suddenly seems to be going a lot smoother than it ever has before. As if to confirm that things are now moving in the right direction the flow of the great river Ganges itself has shifted in a way that has further helped this process along."
# flavor_bng.10.d:0 "The soldiers we sent to Calcutta promptly reduced the new forts and imprisoned the westerners they found inside. As the prisoners then returned to their respective mother countries, however, this incident seems to have grown out of all proportion.\nAmong the freed a story has begun to circulate about a terrible dungeon known as the Black Hole of Calcutta. According to the story the vast majority of the prisoners died due to the horrible conditions they had to endure there. Our local commander assures us that this is not true but that is of little consequence. The English East India traders are doing their utmost to convince their mother country to 'restore order' in our kingdom."
# flavor_bah.2.d:0 "The Bahmani Sultanate is in many ways a colonial state. The Deccan had only been under Muslim control for 20 years when our ancestors threw off the imperialist yoke of Delhi. The vast majority of our subjects are Hindu Marathas, Kannadigas and Telugus.\nWith northern India closed to us by the Delhi Sultans for so long we have had to rely on oversea immigration directly from Persia and the Arab world to fill the needs of our state.\nOur dynasty has therefore always spent much energy trying to attract able and learned men to what has become a rather cosmopolitan kingdom. Since we lost control of the western coast, however, it seems this stream of able people has been transformed into a trickle. If we want to avert a serious crisis we must double our efforts to lure all men of quality here despite the risks."
# flavor_guj.1.d:0 "Our capital Ahmadabad has been growing rapidly ever since it was founded in 1411 and it seems unlikely this will ebb out any time soon. The close proximity of Khambat, one of the greatest ports in India and according to some the busiest port in the world ensures a constant stream of people, goods and capital.\nSuch a rapidly growing city is, however, hard to defend effectively, especially given its position in the middle of the Gujarat plains. Some say we ought to take a more active part in the planning of the city and not only focus on how to adorn it. The system of walls and bastions suggested by our architects may seem staggering but the alternative is a capital almost without defenses."
# flavor_guj.7.d:0 "In a dangerous world it is sometimes good to have contacts that can protect you. With the arrival of the Portuguese in the Indian Ocean it seems uncertain if anyone can be safe at sea anymore. We have received repeated reports of shipping being raided by Christian ships lately. These pirates threaten the trade that our Sultanate lives from and must be stopped.\nIt has recently come to our attention that the Ottoman Empire, distant as it may be, has acquired ports in the red sea. Perhaps it would be wise to contact the Sultan of Constantinople to discuss a possible alliance against these Christian pirates?"
# tyw_events.47.d:0 "[Root.GetName] is under attack, but the enemy has so far not advanced very far into our lands. Our army strategists suggest that we fortify our defenses where they are needed the most. They are, however, turning to [Root.Monarch.GetName] for an opinion on exactly where that would be. It is certainly true that we cannot afford to lose control of our capital but it may still be best to fortify our borders first."
# flavor_per.16.d:0 "If we are to build a truly Persian nation we must create a worthy and truly Persian capital. Isfahan is an old city situated at the heart of the lands of Persia and would fit our ambitions nicely.\nTalented architects from all over our lands stand ready to transform this old city into a proper symbol of our power. This is, however, going to be a both costly and time consuming process."
# flavor_mer.4.d:0 "In an attempt to reconcile our dynasty with our rivals in Marwar one of our princes was married to the Rathore Princess Mira Bai a few years ago. The marriage was to become a quite short affair, however, as the young princess was widowed a few years later.\nAs a widow Mira Bai have become increasingly devoted to Krishna and has been seen wandering the streets of the capital singing and dancing with others of a similarly strong faith. The fact that this behavior is far from fitting for a royal widow has led to some ill will within the royal family. Possibly because of this Mira Bai have now proceeded to leave $CAPITAL_CITY$ and has been heard to be touring the countryside of Rajasthan, proclaiming her love and devotion to Krishna."
# flavor_jnp.2.d:0 "Traditionally Muslim powers in this region have relied militarily on Afghan and Persian cavalry. If we are willing to expand the Hindu influence in our armies, however, the Rajput farming communities that dot the Doab and Gangetic regions would make for an ideal source of infantry. Not only are there many of second sons that would jump at the prospect of becoming soldiers, many of these communities are said to already have mastered the use of firearms better than many of our regular soldiers."
# flavor_jnp.4.d:0 "The site of Jaunpur on the northern bank of the Gomti river has been commanded by a fort long before the arrival of Islam in these lands. The Delhi sultans in their day further fortified the place using materials from many of the buildings of the defeated Rashtrakutas of Kannauj.\nWith the advent of our independent Sultanate in the late 14th century the fort was further strengthened and began to serve as a royal residence. Now that our state has grown into a power in its own right, however, it is high time that we take a new look at the state of the Jaunpur Qila."
# desc_mlc_islamic_laws_enforced:0 "In order to please the more orthodox elements of our religious establishment we have adopted a stricter interpretation of Islamic law less in line with the traditional laws of Malacca. This new direction for the Sultanate has, however, made many non-Muslims fear of becoming a marginalized part of our society."
# flavor_mlc.4.d:0 "Malacca has in many ways been the center of the islamization of the Malay archipelago. Our state itself has, however, always avoided any stern or overly orthodox varieties of Islamic law in favor of keeping it an attractive spot for traders of all nationalities. Instead tradition is relied upon to be the law of the land while orthodox Islamic laws have been reserved for special cases, often related to keeping the public order. While this has upset some of those with more delicate religious sensibilities over the years it has been good for trade and has therefore been supported the Malaccan communities.\nOver time, however, Muslims have become more and more dominant in our state and due to its importance for the spread of Islam among the islands some have even begun to consider Malacca a pilgrimage site. Perhaps the time has come to introduce a bit more orthodoxy in the laws and customs of our state?"
# flavor_mlc.7.d:0 "Ships from distant shores is no rare thing in Malacca yet today an unusual visitor arrived in our city. The captain presents himself as coming from a Christian kingdom far to the west known as Portugal and wants to sign a trade agreement by which his country would become one of the most favored trading partners of our state.\nThe Muslim Gujarati community, however, is propagating very strongly that the man is dangerous and that his country is a sworn enemy to our religion. The Gujaratis are so vehemently opposed to Portuguese presence here that they have already begun to act with open hostility towards the newcomers, confiscating their goods and boarding their ships. There is a risk that this could get out of hand very quickly..."
# prices.19.d:0 "Permanent navies have gone from being exceptional cases to becoming the norm. The institutions devoted to the control of these new navies are beginning to take a much more active part in the procurement of supplies for the construction, rationing and upkeep of their ships."
# prices.20.d:0 "The bronze cannon has made its entrance on the battlefield and is here to stay. The materials needed to feed the growing cannon-making industries have led to an explosion in the demand for copper over the last few years and prices have risen as a result."
# prices.21.d:0 "Tea drinking is far from a new element in Japanese culture. The continued development of the Japanese Tea Ceremony during the 16th century, however, has led to the drink now becoming commonplace throughout Japanese society."
# prices.25.d:0 "Our direct control over some of the dye producing areas of northern India has attracted a number of fortune seekers aiming to expand the production into our lands in Bengal. Some parts of Bengal would seem ideal to grow Indigo and most seem to judge that it is likely that these efforts will be successful if allowed. Growing Indigo and process of turning the plants into dye is hard work, however, and allowing these unscrupulous people free reins here might lead to difficulties down the road."
# prices.26.d:0 "Initially many types of tropical wood would be considered too brittle by woodworkers. With the development of veneering, however, it has become possible to make use of Ebony and other tropical woods selected for their beauty rather than their strength. As a result the creation of beautiful and original cabinets and other prestige furniture from tropical woods has grown into a major business."
# prices.27.d:0 "After many years of slow declining the Elephant population of South East Asia is now at an all time low. The demand for Elephants and Ivory products in both South East Asia and China has, however, never faltered and as a result the price of elephants and their ivory is rising."
# prices.29.d:0 "The use of Cocoa to create a hot beverage is a custom inherited from the American natives. While the new drink caught on quickly in some parts of European society it has taken some time, and large amounts of sugar, before it reached a larger acceptance. With that out of the way, however, the demand for chocolate is now steadily increasing in the old world."
# flavor_ori.2.d:0 "When Kapilendra Deva overthrew the last of the Eastern Ganga Kings in 1434 Orissa was in a sad state. Muslim incursions from the north and west as well as rivalry with other neighbors to the south had reduced the kingdom greatly. Since then Raja Kapilendra has quickly turned all of that around. In consecutive wars with Bengal, the Reddys of Andhra, the Bahmani Sultans and the Vijayanagar empire, Orissa has grown in both size and strength under his leadership.\nThis constant warfare has, however, taken its toll on the population of our kingdom and an unusually bad harvest season has now resulted in growing popular unrest. It has been suggested that the public mood would be improved if we temporarily lifted the traditional Salt tax and otherwise devoted our attention to the public good a bit more."
# flavor_ori.3.d:0 "After a long life the great warrior king Kapilendra lies on his deathbed. To the shock of his 18 legitimate sons, however, the old king, guided by the voice of Jagannath, has elected to make his illegitimate son Purushottama his heir.\nAs the king draws his last breath the royal succession is far from assured as Hamvira, the favorite candidate until this date, has fled to the south where he has taken up arms against Purushottama."
# flavor_zan.1.d:1 "Most of the Swahili states are to this day ruled by dynasties that claim to be descended from the first Islamic migration into this region. The Islam practiced by these 'Shirazis', as they call themselves, is, however, not the most orthodox form of the religion. Many older local ceremonies are performed daily in our court and the Shirazi lineages are considered to have magical abilities that give them the right to rule these cities.\nAs the wealth of Kilwa and the other Swahili states grows, however, new waves of foreigners continue to arrive in great numbers. Traders from Oman, Persia, the Bahmani kingdom and other faraway lands have made our cities their home and a rising class of indigenous merchants has made these groups their partners. Many of the newcomers are abhorred by our traditions. If we would adopt a more orthodox form of Islam this would certainly help our relations with the other states of the Indian Ocean, but there is a very real risk that it would undermine our own rule and hurt relations with the other Swahili states."
# flavor_zan.2.d:0 "With more and more foreign traders arriving in the Swahili coast from orthodox Islamic states our old Shirazi ways have come more and more under fire. We have watched with disgust as some of the old Shirazi dynasties of the Swahili coast have been overthrown by a rising class of indigenous traders allied with the newcomers.\nAs one of the oldest and most powerful Shirazi dynasties, however, we still stand strong. In order to suitably impress foreigners and domestic troublemakers alike it might be best if we assigned our scribes to create a chronicle over our famous lineage, so that none may doubt our Shirazi origin and the old Islamic roots of our dynasty."
# flavor_zan.5.d:0 "When Sultan Ismâ'îl ascended the throne of Kilwa in 1442 his rule was questioned by the local rulers in Zanzibar who supported his relative Said's bid to become sultan. Said's plot was, however, thwarted by the royal vizier Suleiman and the emir Muhammad al-Mazlum.\nWith the passing of Ismâ'îl himself, however, it seems Suleiman and Muhammad have decided that the time has come for them to rule in their own name. Acting quickly they have used their influence to secure the capital for themselves and have agreed to share power by taking the throne in turns."

# protestantism_events.10.d:0 "There are still those, especially in the countryside who oppose the State Church of [Root.Owner.GetName] and who long to return to the embrace of the Roman Church. There is, however, a big difference between religious doubts and open rebellion and so far things have been quiet in [Root.GetName]. The State Church has in turn been content to leave most of these people alone as long as they attend services and pay their taxes.\nIt seems this peace was not meant to last. The recent collection of Church Silver in the area has been regarded as an open declaration of war by the local population and they are now taking up arms to protect their Churches from the greedy hands of [Root.Owner.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
# protestantism_events.12.d:0 "$NATURAL_SCIENTIST$$PHILOSOPHER$ is famous for $NATURAL_SCIENTIST_POSS_PRONOUN$$PHILOSOPHER_POSS_PRONOUN$ sharp intellect and $NATURAL_SCIENTIST_POSS_PRONOUN$$PHILOSOPHER_POSS_PRONOUN$ presence in our court lends a certain grandeur to our name. $NATURAL_SCIENTIST_CAP_ADJ$$PHILOSOPHER_CAP_ADJ$ is, however, also a firm Catholic and has been allowed to practice $NATURAL_SCIENTIST_POSS_PRONOUN$$PHILOSOPHER_POSS_PRONOUN$ faith as he wishes in order to come here. It would be unthinkable for the Church of [Root.GetName] itself to criticize [Root.Monarch.GetName] but in the streets of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] there is talk of $NATURAL_SCIENTIST$$PHILOSOPHER$ trying to plant subversive Catholic ideas in the head of [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
# protestantism_events.16.d:0 "Years have passed and [Root.Monarch.GetName] has proven to be a fair and just ruler. The clergy no longer fear a sudden Catholic coup and their hatred of Papism has been tempered by [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s understanding of the religion.\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself], however, is troubled. As the years have gone by [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has come to realize that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] personal faith lies much closer to the Catholics that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has done so much to protect and not with the dogmatic State Church of [Root.GetName]"
# protestantism_events.23.d:0 "As Christendom grows ever more divided the trickle of religious refugees has grown into a steady stream. Religious conflicts in major Catholic states have caused many Protestant to leave their old home countries. As a Protestant country with our own Church we would be able to offer them protection and we could also make good use of their skills and assets.\nProtestantism is, however, far from a unified faith and it is not very likely that all those who come to us will find the Church of [Root.GetName] to match their own beliefs fully. While it would be admirable to receive all Protestant Immigrants it might be more prudent to hand pick those that possess skills we could make good use of."
# protestantism_events.24.d:0 "Having a Bible Translation sanctioned by the state has done much to unify the Protestant faith in our country and it is the opinion of both the general public and most theologians that our translation has resulted in a book far more true to the origins of our religion.\nThere are, however, also some who find the official Bible translation very lacking. Some groups claim that it is simply outdated and in need of modernization, some that it is too favorable to the ruling state and that we have attempted to make use of it to pacify our subjects. Others again simply see it as not going far enough and still maintain many of the errors that have accumulated over the years in previous versions of the Bible."
# desc_controversy_over_official_bible:0 "We have published an official Bible to be used by our State Church which has done a great deal to promote the uniformity of our faith and to wash away old Catholic baggage. It is, however, impossible for a single translation to satisfy all of those that previously used their own various Bible translations and it seems groups from all over the religious spectra has managed to find some passage they object to. Nonetheless we have elected to stick by our version, confident that it will outlast them all in the end."
# protestantism_events.25.d:0 "It is no secret that the marriage of [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] spouse isn't the most loving union and producing an heir has turned out to be quite problematic. It is rumored that [Root.Monarch.GetName] has had a number of extra marital affairs and the reputation of our Kingdom is running the risk of becoming tarnished. [Root.Monarch.GetName] will not hear of a word about divorce, however, and considers such a thing deeply immoral.\nInstead [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] argues that if bigamy could work for the patriarchs then perhaps that could be used as a precedent for allowing [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] a second union. The Reformers that have been contacted to give their opinions on this have been very hesitant, to say the least, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] seems determined this is the best solution to [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] problem."
# protestantism_events.28.d:0 "Whether the body of Christ is really physically present during the Eucharist or not was one of the main points on which Protestants and Catholics disagreed during the reformation. Some, however, have trouble even accepting the Lutheran Sacramental Union. A recent publication that has gained some circulation in our country seems to have been authored by one of these groups. It will undoubtedly be forgotten soon enough but in the short term the legitimacy of our State Church is being questioned."
# protestantism_events.36.d:0 "Due to our motherland's policy of sending religious heretics to the colonies a wide variety of different faiths can be found in our settlements. While they could all be said to be protestant in some form or another they have views that are often starkly opposed to each other on many issues. The province of [Root.GetName] has been settled by large numbers of two theologically opposed churches, one stands closer to the Reformed churches of Europe, while the other stands closer to the Protestant Churches. Both are, however, just as opposed to the control of the State Church they have left behind. Tensions are running high and it may be best to step in now to keep them apart before things escalate."
# protestantism_events.38.d:0 "Few are as tempted by the promise of a new life in the colonies as religious dissenters. As a result our lands are home to a wide variety of different Christian faiths which thanks to the great amount of space to be settled is not as big a problem as it would be back in our mother country.\nIt is not entirely without local conflicts, however, and it seems word of some of these have now reached our home country. We have received orders from home to be more careful about those demanding religious freedoms in our lands."
# desc_prot_stopped_witch_trials:0 "A number of Witch Trials in this area has threatened to turn local society apart with neighbors reporting on neighbors. The state has, however, stepped in and attempted to deflect the situation. Everyone is not happy with this solution but tensions seem to be decreasing."
# desc_bandit_leader_returned:0 "A former Bandit leader with quite a popular following has set up his business once again in this region. By now, however, he is both an older and frailer man and it is no doubt a question of time until his activities cease one way or the other."
# buddhism_events.2.d:0 "Due to a combination of lacking monastic discipline and a faltering economy many of the great monasteries of [Root.GetName] have seen their membership dwindling over the last few years. A concerned Bhikkhu has approached the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] with a warning that unless something is done soon the dire situation may lead to the last few monks abandoning their vows or seeking to join monasteries elsewhere, leaving [Root.GetName] impoverished both spiritually and economically. There are, however, many local landowners more than ready to infringe on the land an empty monastery would leave behind. As the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] is meant to protect Monastic life in [Root.Owner.GetName] it will be clear to many observers that the responsibility for whatever happens will rest on [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] shoulders."
# buddhism_events.7.d:0 "A white elephant has been captured in the hinterlands of [From.GetName] and [From.Monarch.GetName] has wisely interpreted this as a sign of the productive alliance of our two peoples. This is the greatest gift a ruler could possibly bestow upon us and will likely be regarded very well by our population. It will, however, also be quite costly to take care of this rare beast even though we could hardly refuse to do so."
# buddhism_events.9.d:0 "Not all men are cut out to lead a life of war and it seems the conflict our country is currently in has made some of them realize it. The number of deserters seeking to hide behind the walls of the monasteries is not big but they set a dangerous example. As a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] it is, however, our duty to protect the monasteries and while we have repeatedly warned them not to accept men like these it seems some still do."
# buddhism_events.15.d:0 "It is at times such as these, when our country is characterized by relative tranquility that we are reminded to look at those who are less fortunate. The recent crop yields have been neither failures nor a great success and as a result most have food and the state have ample grain supplies. There are, however, still some unfortunate who haven't got enough food to feed themselves."
# buddhism_events.18.d:0 "Recently [Root.Monarch.GetName] have come under attack by those who feel his rule has been one of extravagance and conspicuous consumption. Some of our ministers, however, insist that a certain amount of luxury is necessary for a ruler, especially when dealing with foreign monarchs and their emissaries."
# buddhism_events.23.d:0 "A conflict has arisen in one of the more influential monasteries of [Root.GetName] after the death of a monk. The monk in question came from a very influential lay family and during his time in robes had managed to acquire a rich set of valuable manuscripts and an assortment of Buddha images and other things. While monks cannot own property as such the law still allows for a dedicated disciple to inherit these things and be considered as a son to the monk. In this case a young disciple has taken care of the monk as he lay at his end. There are, however, others interested, the monastery itself has argued that they should get the inheritance and would likely be very thankful for support in this matter. The lay family of the monk have also approached [Root.Monarch.GetName] hoping to inherit not only the manuscripts and images but also some of the land they have donated to the monastery while their family member was part of it."
# buddhism_events.24.d:0 "The monasteries of [Root.GetName] harbor some of the oldest and finest lineages in [Root.Owner.Country.GetName] and have therefore always been influential. They have, however, over the years come to grow more and more powerful and have also come to cultivate a disturbingly close relationship to other powers in the region. It is hard by now to find any person of influence in one of the monasteries that do not come from one of the richer noble families in the region. Monastic discipline is important but attacking a powerful Monastery as entrenched as this is not done lightly, a tempting option is to simply ally with the monks and let them lend their power to ours."
# buddhism_events.26.d:0 "The campaign in [Root.GetName] to catch the leader of the bandits in the area has finally proved successful. During the hunt for him his popularity has only increased, however, and it is clear this is a very dangerous man to be alive. The commander of the troops that caught the man recommends that we kill him now and not risk that he may one day incite those who idealize him to revolt against us. One of our ministers, however, wishes to remind [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] that to save a life is better than building a seven level pagoda."
# buddhism_events.27.d:0 "The man we once banished for banditry in one of our provinces seems to have returned to our country, ready to once again make life hard for our local subjects. There is still a lingering popularity in some parts of the country and it is feared he may make good use of this to avoid the authorities once more.\nBy all accounts, however, he is an older and weaker man now and while the situation is still problematic it seems clear he cannot go on for long this time."
# buddhism_events.28.d:0 "The reputation of the bandit leader we had executed a few years ago has refused to die with him. While his band of brigands can no longer terrorize traders and endanger the integrity of our roads the myth of the bandit leader has grown out of all proportion. Eventually his fate will surely be one of many old stories told to young kids with little meaning, right now, however, it is a story told to ridicule [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] rule."
# buddhism_events.29.d:0 "The emissary of one of our neighboring countries has given grave affront to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] by refusing to participate in a ceremony he was invited to attend. [Root.Monarch.GetName] is furious and while there can be some doubt as to if the slight was deliberate or not the public clearly sees it as such.\nIf we do not publicly condemn the ambassador we risk losing face, the council of ministers, however, urge caution."
# buddhism_events.30.d:0 "It is with great pleasure that [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] have watched some of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] childhood friends climb the state hierarchy but now this has made us the target of accusations of favoritism. The local governor of [Root.GetName] has been singled out by these accusations and the situation would undoubtedly be defused by replacing him no matter how competent he has been on that post."
# buddhism_events.31.d:0 "Pali law is generally practiced in one form or another in many Buddhist countries and especially among the Theravada ones. While these laws are not collected and written down by the states themselves they do vary from country to country and at times a collection will have to be updated or renewed. A wise monk has undertaken such a collection recently in [Root.GetName] and has produced an updated version of one of the most commonly used law collections in our country.\nAs the collection itself builds upon actual cases it can, however, be seen as quite an up to date commentary on the rulings of [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
# buddhism_events.33.d:0 "Many ages ago Mongol rulers adopted the Buddhist religion and sought to spread it among their people. Over the years, however, many have returned to the old ways of the Shamans. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has always been fascinated by the legacy of the likes of Kublai Khan and the empires they once created in the name of that religion. As word reach us of a dynamic and growing Tibetan monastic order it was therefore clear to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] that this needed to be investigated.\nThe emissary of the Lama now stands before us and has explained that the Lama indeed expects that [Root.Monarch.GetName] is a reincarnation of Kublai Khan. He is also prepared to support our rule if we allow him to spread his sect in all the lands we control."
# buddhism_events.34.d:0 "Our Messenger from Tibet has returned with news of a powerful religious leader who has become interested in the cause of [Root.Monarch.GetName] and his dynasty. If he is to come to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], however, we must be able to do far more than just guarantee his safety. For the Lama to tie his destiny with ours we must swear that he and his future incarnations will be given the proper respect and influence in our realm and that we will create a great Monastery for him and his disciples. If we cannot make these guarantees we will have to content ourselves with receiving a delegation of monks eager to found a new Monastery in our lands."
# buddhism_events.35.d:0 "Conversion from a Shamanist country to a Buddhist one does not happen overnight and a great deal of people within our borders still worship in the old ways. Eager to spread his religion, however, the foremost Lama in our country have condemned the common Shamanic figures that many common people still honor and demanded that they all be destroyed."
# subject_interaction_events.41.d:1 "Of late one of our subjects has seen fit to remind us of the tensions caused by us owning land in [rightful_province.GetName], that they view as rightfully theirs. Handing it back to them would show us to be a benevolent power, however, such a move could also weaken us."
# desc_demands_representation:0 "The people in this area are demanding greater representation in the central government. The movement is centered on their old provincial assemblies which they feel should be recreated at a national level."
# parlaments.2.d:0 "Due to its seat in parliament [Root.GetName] can boast quite an influence on the politics of our country. That seat is, however, the only thing that distinguishes the area from much richer parts of our state. This is something that the local landowners have come to realize and through a combination of bribes and threats the votes of [Root.GetName] have come to be controlled entirely by a few corrupt yet influential individuals."
# parlaments.22.d:0 "Given its great influence over the politics of our country it would be easy to assume that all MPs attended parliamentary sessions with great enthusiasm, eager to do the most with the power they have been trusted with. This is, however, far from the case and in any given parliament there will be some that never show up, either because they are still enjoying their estates in the countryside or because they decide to partake in the many joys of the capital. The problem has grown more and more lately and we fear foreign dignitaries are laughing at us behind our backs. There are a number of measures that might be taken to increase attendence but none that the current MPs would take very kindly too."
# parlaments.24.d:0 "Due to the current poor government finances any contribution to the state coffers is very welcome. It is therefore with some enthusiasm that we receive the representatives of a number of rich city assemblies offering to help. Their price, however, is greater representation in government in general and formalized ways for the state to ask for their help in the future."

# desc_tengri_devout_muslim:0 "The concerned Muslims of our country have found it in themselves to trust our ruler after our adoption of much stricter Islamic rules for the life at court. This insistence on Muslim ritual and tradition has, however, made many of our more traditional subjects doubt our right to rule them."
# tengri_events.2.d:0 "Some parts of our society have been more willing than others to embrace the [Root.SecondaryReligion.GetName] faith. It has, however, gained great popularity among our administrators and as they look abroad for spiritual inspiration they have also come to pick up a thing or two about statecraft."
# tengri_events.5.d:0 "A local crisis is underway in an area under our control. A number of minor problems have together come to cause calamity, famine and destruction of property. The population of the area are not followers of the Tengri ways and have implored us to handle the catastrophe according to the new traditions of our state. Our court Shamans have, however, quickly taken the position that they must be allowed to remedy the situation. There seems to be no solution that will placate both groups."
# tengri_events.14.d:0 "Our country is in some ways at the frontier of the Islamic world and as such mostly attracts the attention of traveling Sufis or merchants. It seems, however, that a fervent preacher has managed to convince a large group of warriors to submit to this foreign god and these men are now taking part in our current wars against their religious enemies with a newfound fervor."
# tengri_events.17.d:0 "The power of the Khoja lineage over our subjects is almost too great. They are constantly meddling in legal cases, religious policy and the day-to-day business of our country. The Khoja is, however, still one of the most valiant supporters of the throne. With the crowning of [Root.Monarch.GetName] we will be expected to affirm the ties to the Khoja and perhaps extend his privileges even further."
# tengri_events.22.d:0 "Strange tales are reaching us from the provinces of a traveling Buddhist Monk using his wisdom to overcome various problems and spreading his faith among the many people benefiting from his help. Not everyone is happy with these advances among the common people, however, as they often involve defeating the local Shamans.\nIn [Root.GetName] this monk reportedly defeated a local Shaman and cured a local princess from a severe malady, leaving the traditional rituals appearing poor and insufficient. As a result the local lord has banned traditional rituals in his lands and is instead promoting [Root.SecondaryReligion.GetName]."
# tengri_events.23.d:0 "For some time Vajrayana monks have been gaining followers in the province of [Root.GetName] and while their influence is still quite limited they have apparently taken it upon themselves to go one step further in their missionary activity. Reports are reaching [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] of the destruction and incineration of our ancestral idols. The general reception of this policy has not turned out as the monks would have hoped, however, as the locals are now defending themselves from both the monks and the central authority that favors them."
# tengri_events.25.d:0 "With the increasing influence of the [Root.SecondaryReligion.GetName] faith in our country a number of new monasteries have been founded in our country. Their purpose is both to harbor the [Root.SecondaryReligion.GetName] monks that have come to our lands and the slowly growing number of native [Root.GetAdjective] monks.\nTraditional landholders don't seem to be very impressed by the pretensions of these newcomers, however, and have been helping themselves to the lands reserved for the monks. The monks claim that the land would be made more productive under their control while the land holders feel they are demanding the right to what is already theirs."
# tengri_events.32.d:0 "Participation in many traditional rituals is reserved for our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and those closest to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. While this means the Confucian elite of our country cannot take part this has not often been a problem as they view such 'superstitious' rituals and sacrifices with at best mild displeasure. This insistence to keep our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and his closest from the old [Root.Religion.GetName] elites separate from our other subjects has, however, led to an unnecessarily sharp divide between the two groups. This, rather than the rituals themselves, seems to be a constant source of irritation and misunderstandings, even at the very top of our society."
# tengri_events.40.d:0 "A group of Christian missionaries from abroad has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and are eager to spread the word of God among the heathens. Not wanting to come into conflict with our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], however, they come seeking our blessing. The leader of the group has approached the throne asking to be given the right to spread the Christian faith in a region under our control unhindered."
# tengri_events.45.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has always taken a great interest in both our adopted religion and those that practice it. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] has, however, not always led a life that many of our Christian subjects would approve of. Between the influence of Shamans at court and the habits of [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] there are many that feel we are risking divine punishment.\nPerhaps we should consider instituting some more clearly Christian rules for our court and ruler? Restricting the influence of Shamans, the number of allowed wives and generally the number of officially sanctioned rituals would go a long way towards placating the Christian communities."
# tengri_events.50.d:0 "While the Fire temples of [Root.GetName] probably seem a bit unorthodox to them our society is still attracting a number of Zoroastrians in the diaspora. Ever since they left Persia behind almost a millennium ago they have grown used to being the minority and seem content to mix with our society at large. Some, however, have come asking for an area of their own where they can live and worship in their traditional ways."
# cossack_estate_events.6.d:0 "While few would dispute their influence on the Steppes the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ have many things working against them when it comes to gaining influence in the halls of power. The $ESTATE_NOBLES$ despise them and would see them all brought to work as serfs on their latifundia and their manners have not brought them many friends in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName].\nLately, however, things have been going their way. They have managed to defend their settlements and their services to the state as raiders are undisputable."
# cossack_estate_events.10.d:0 "There has always been tension between the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ and the other estates, if nothing else because of their uncommon manners and diverse backgrounds. Lately, however, these have increased considerably. The $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ are alarmed at the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ raids and claim that they are targeting shipments of their grain. The $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ themselves claim that they are only attacking the Tartars and brigands in the area and that the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ are simply mistaken. As there is little in the way of government representation in the area it is difficult to ascertain the truth but there is clearly friction between these two groups and we are expected to either reprimand or sanction one side in this conflict."
# tribal_estate_events.1.d:0 "The difference between tax collection, extortion or demanding tribute can sometimes be somewhat vague. In many parts of our country taxes are collected by the Nomadic Clans in ways very similar to how they would have conducted themselves during a raid.\nToday an emissary from some of our more well-to-do subjects arrived to tell a tale of how the would-be tax collectors pillaged their lands and then laid siege to their fortified homes. They now demand retribution from the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and for the perpetrators to be punished. The tribes would, however, likely not take kindly to any such restrictions of their conduct."
# church_estate_events.1.d:0 "The $ESTATE_CHURCH$ has long been one of the foremost pillars of the [Root.GetAdjective] realm, providing not only spiritual guidance but also administrators, judges and diplomats for the benefit of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. In return for these great services no ecclesiastical manor, monastery or other estate pay any taxes to the state and the temporal authorities do not meddle in the internal affairs of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$.\nTimes grow dire, however, and the state has to cover an increasing number of expenses. Suggestions that perhaps the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ might make a voluntary contribution have not been favorably received."
# church_estate_events.101.d:0 "The $ESTATE_CHURCH$ has long been one of the foremost pillars of the [Root.GetAdjective] realm, providing not only spiritual guidance but also administrators, judges and diplomats for the benefit of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. In return for these great services many donations have been made over the years, both by the state and by others, in the form of villages to support the Brahman communities. These Brahmadeyas have over the centuries made our $ESTATE_CHURCH$ quite rich.\nTimes grow dire, however, and the state has to cover an increasing number of expenses. Suggestions that perhaps the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ might make a voluntary contribution have not been favorably received."
# church_estate_events.102.d:0 "The $ESTATE_CHURCH$ has long been one of the foremost pillars of the [Root.GetAdjective] realm, providing not only spiritual guidance but also administrators, judges and diplomats for the benefit of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. In return for these great services many donations have been made over the years, both by the state and by others, to the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ and the gods they serve. These gifts have over the centuries made the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ quite rich and influential.\nTimes grow dire, however, and the state has to cover an increasing number of expenses. Suggestions that perhaps the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ might make a voluntary contribution have not been favorably received."
# church_estate_events.103.d:0 "The $ESTATE_CHURCH$ have always been the foremost pillars of the [Root.GetAdjective] realm, providing not only spiritual guidance but also administrators, judges and diplomats for the benefit of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. In return for these great services many lands have been set aside as religious properties, exempt from most of our taxes. This way the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ and the many fine projects they support can be provided for.\nTimes grow dire, however, and the state has to cover an increasing number of expenses. Suggestions that perhaps the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ might make a voluntary contribution have not been favorably received."
# church_estate_events.104.d:0 "The $ESTATE_CHURCH$ has long been one of the foremost pillars of the [Root.GetAdjective] realm, providing not only spiritual guidance but also administrators, judges and diplomats for the benefit of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. In return for these great services many donations have been made over the years, both by the state and by others, to the $ESTATE_CHURCH$.

# church_estate_events.105.d:0 "The $ESTATE_CHURCH$ have long been one of the foremost pillars of the [Root.GetAdjective] realm, providing not only spiritual guidance but also administrators, law scholars and diplomats for the benefit of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. In return for these great services many donations have been made over the years, both by the state and by others, to the great $ESTATE_CHURCH$ and their extensive land properties. These gifts have over the centuries made the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ quite rich and influential.\nTimes grow dire, however, and the state has to cover an increasing number of expenses. Suggestions that perhaps the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ might make a voluntary contribution have not been favorably received."
# church_estate_events.9.d:0 "There has always been some discrepancy between the religion actually taught and defended by the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ and the actual faith of the people in the provinces. Most of the time the differences are small enough that the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ chooses to ignore them to instead focus on reinforce the more orthodox spiritual ideas of the people.\nIt seems, however, that certain ideas that are quite unorthodox, if rooted in old traditions, have begun to spread together with the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith among our non-[Root.Religion.GetName] subjects. The resulting mix of old heathen ideas, popular superstitions and the actual [Root.Religion.GetName] itself has been quite too much for the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ to stomach even if it seems to have made conversion a much more attractive proposition for our heathen subjects."
# church_estate_events.10.d:0 "The time has come for the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ to appoint a new leader to assist our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in the capital. The likely candidate is an old cleric with a solid history as a prominent member of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ behind him. He has, however, also acquired many enemies during his life who now hope to see a somewhat younger candidate with a less ugly past be appointed. As [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] it would not be hard to influence this election to the younger candidate who would likely be more loyal. To be seen to meddle in the affairs of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$, however, would very likely weaken the faction in the long run."
# nobles_estate_events.1.d:0 "Many of the families of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ won their current position due to the actions of a forefather who served the state in times of war. For most of their sons a life in the field is therefore the only imaginable career. With the modernization of the army, however, common officers are no longer entirely unusual. Members of the Nobility have now approached us asking that we guarantee what they feel is the given right of their class. No man should be able to take service as a commander in the [Root.GetAdjective] armies who is not of noble birth!"
# nobles_estate_events.9.d:0 "None of our subjects are more associated with war than the $ESTATE_NOBLES$. Generations ago their families served us or the states before us and won their current status on the field of battle. Ever since then most of them have kept their old traditions alive, training for a life in the field and making connections with others of the same inclination.\nThe current state of affairs in our country, however, has left us with few members of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ willing to fight our battles. Insubordination has become widespread among the higher officers and we have good reason to suspect more than a few hope for an unsuccessful war."
# burghers_estate_events.1.d:0 "The status of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ does not rest on the same old traditions as that of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ or the $ESTATE_CHURCH$. Instead they have had to make their own fortunes by working diligently and then risking the profit to again expand their businesses. As a rule, however, this has gone very well for them lately. While not as prestigious business is in many ways the backbone of our economy and through their control of the coins the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ have managed to increase their power over our country."
# burghers_estate_events.12.d:0 "Trade over large distances can be risky, if profitable. The weather, brigands and pirates remain a threat on land as well as on water. Normally the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ can cope with a certain amount of mishaps and have their own ways to protect themselves and insure their cargo. Lately, however, things have been going badly for a large number of Merchant families and some are at risk of bankruptcy. It may be prudent to offer some financial compensation to get them back on their feet."
# dhimmi_estate_events.6.d:0 "Traditionally the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ are excluded from service in many of the higher positions in the administration. Instead these are generally given to faithful Muslim literati. As our government apparatus grows, however, it has a constant thirst for more learned men and among the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ there are many that would fit this description. While some would consider it unorthodox we could probably greatly benefit from recruiting from their numbers."

# nahuatl_events.18.d:0 "During the time in his house of youth [Root.Heir.GetName] became quite adept at the traditional Ollamalitzli ball game, but as an adult he has had to give up on this habit. As the game is played throughout the different districts of [Root.Capital.GetName], however, [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] is often seen as a spectator at the various courts near temples or markets even as an adult. This habit must also extend to participation in the wild betting that is often associated with the game as [Root.Heir.GetName] has come to you today asking for help to pay [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] debts."
# nahuatl_events.25.d:0 "As the spring equinox and the planting season draws near the time of the Tlacaxipehualiztli is upon us. The time has come to sacrifice all prisoners of war at the temple of Xipe-Totec. Their blood will feed the sun and their skins will be worn by their captors and the priests of the temple before being saved in the holy cave.\nAs we have not fought any wars recently, however, we have an acute shortage of prisoners to sacrifice. This is in itself a bad omen and things will likely only get worse if we are unable to spill more blood today."
# nahuatl_events.26.d:0 "The rich Pochteca trade guilds are essential to the trade network of Mesoamerica and their members are generally free to cross our borders as they please.

We must thank the gods that have helped us keep this world alive for sparing us today."
# inti_events.2.d:0 "The priests of Inti have made it clear that [Root.Heir.GetName] must take his sister as his primary wife to please the gods. Many of his ancestors and even the god of the sun himself have married this way within the family and kept the bloodline pure. The boy's mother, however, refuses to hear of this and will not give her consent.\nThe proper way to solve this schism would be to ask our ancestor, the mummy that is the head of our Panaca lineage for guidance."
# inti_events.19.d:0 "The state policy to arrange marriages in [Root.GetName] has paid off.

# flavor_hun.14.d:0 "Desperate for aid our Catholic rebels have turned to the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName] for protection. The Catholic estates have now elected [From.Monarch.GetName] to be their [From.Monarch.GetTitle] and are eagerly awaiting the arrival of [From.GetAdjective] armies.\nThe estates of the core land of our [Root.GovernmentName], however, remain loyal to [Root.Monarch.GetName] and condemn the actions of the Catholic interlopers."
# flavor_hun.20.d:0 "[belgrade_localized.GetName]'s position on the confluence of the Danube and its tributary, the Sava, makes it an ideal defensive position and a primary objective for anyone invading our country from the south. For this reason previous kings acquired the Banate of [belgrade_localized.GetName] from the Serbian Despot Durad Brankovic. The fortress itself, however, grand, is in dire need of repair and upgrade.\nUnfortunately the Hungarian nobility is currently unwilling to contribute to the maintenance of the fortress in [belgrade_localized.GetName], or any of the other border forts of our kingdom. They are unable to see the [threat_to_hungary.GetAdjective] threat and say this would weaken them and invite the crown to infringe on their rights. If we wish to see our defensive line properly maintained the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will need to pay for it directly out of the state coffers."
# flavor_hun.22.d:0 "Ever since the Reformed thinkers of [reformed_origin.GetCapitalName] began to spread their religious ideas they have had a strong following in our kingdom. Reformed ideas such as predestination have struck home among noble and commoner alike and Reformed schools and colleges have begun to crop up in many of our provinces. With the hesitant acceptance of the second Helvetic Confession, the [Root.GetAdjective] Reformed churches have also begun to unite with the other Reformed churches of our time..\nThe Catholic clergy, however, have always been strong supporters of royal power and look at these developments with distrust. While strong, the Reformed church remains young and vulnerable. Do we want to give the Reformed church space to grow or should we attempt to root it out before it is too late?"
# flavor_hun.27.d:0 "Romanians, or Vlachs, have been part of our lands in Transylvania for centuries but have had little representation in the Transylvanian Estates.

# flavor_hun.31.d:0 "The many and rich mines of Upper Hungary are in many ways vital to our economic interests and have therefore often been afforded much greater liberties than we tolerate for other settlements in our country. The german saying 'Stadtluft macht frei' holds true both for the cities themselves and for anyone serfs who might find their way into the communities. With bullion short in supply all over Europe the city leagues are now richer and more sure of themselves than ever.\nSome of our nobles, however, argue that we are allowing them far too free reins and that we should at the very least demand that they provide for the defence of our country."
# flavor_hun.33.d:0 "In the wake of wars and conflicts an increasing number of people have turned to banditry and guerrilla warfare. Disillusioned and impoverished, these men have no qualms about if they cause harm to us or our enemies as they move around our kingdom. They are, however, proving more of a problem for foreign armies in many ways. If we turn a blind eye to their transgressions, these irregulars might even prove a strong addition to our own armies."
# flavor_eng.EVTDESC9118:0 "Queen Elizabeth I sought to bring about a religious settlement with the objective of establishing in England a Protestant Anglican Church with herself as the Supreme Governor. Things began to fray around the edges when Mary Queen of Scots fled to England. The problem for Elizabeth I was that Mary was a Catholic claimant to the English throne. Elizabeth I had Mary locked away in various castles, but she still became the center of numerous conspiracies to overthrow the upstarts who had displaced the ancient aristocracy. Their basic idea was to marry Mary to Norfolk, England's only Duke. This combination represented a serious threat to Elizabeth I but Norfolk seemed undecided and continued to delay until Elizabeth I invited him to London whereupon she locked him in the Tower. Elizabeth I suspected that the Earls of Northumberland, Westmorland and Cumberland were involved in the conspiracy and invited them to London as well. The Earls guessed their accommodation would be the Tower and opted instead for a rebellion which began at about midnight on the 9 November 1569. The Catholic faith had survived in the North and there was real resentment against the extension of Tudor domination and Elizabeth I's new men. The Earl of Northumberland mustered his troops in Richmond on the 16 November. Sir George was appointed provost marshal and martial law was declared. Elizabeth I ordered that 700 of the riffraff be executed, 200 of these were to be from or around Richmond. How many were actually executed is not known but seemingly it was a smaller number, perhaps around 57, 12 of whom were from Richmond. The decade after the Rebellion was a difficult period for Catholics who faced constant persecution. Religious meetings were held in secret, away from the eyes of unfriendly informants. It seems, however, that the few gentry who were accused in court of holding Catholic beliefs were the 'mere tip of a great pyramid' which represented a hidden underground movement."
# flavor_spa.EVTDESC1001:0 "The Laws of Burgos was a set of laws concerning the behavior of Spaniards in America that were issued in the city of Burgos in 1512. They especially concerned the treatment of the indigenous peoples. Though the laws authorized colonizers to forcibly grouping together Indians to work for them, the laws also regulated rules regarding work, pay, provisioning and living quarters. It also prohibited any form of punishment by others than the authorities. The laws, however, did little to ease the suffering of the Indians due to lax implementation."
# flavor_spa.EVTDESC3160:0 "Southern parts of Spain were inhabited mostly by Moriscos - Muslims who had converted to Catholicism under the threat of expulsion by Ferdinand and Isabella following the Reconquista. Many, however, continued secretly to practice Islam, and at times provided the Ottoman Turks with information facilitating Turkish raids on the Spanish coast. Persecuted by the Spanish Inquisition and subjected to restrictive legislation, the Moriscos rose in a bloody rebellion (1568-71), which Philip II put down with the help of Don John of Austria. The Moriscos prospered in spite of persecutions and furthered Spanish agriculture, trade, and industries. However, in 1609 Philip III, influenced by the Duke of Lerma, decreed their expulsion for both religious and political reasons, and the Moriscos to leave the Kingdom, only allwing them to keep what they could carry. Everything else was confiscated. The expulsions came to hurt the Spanish economy for generations."
# flavor_spa.EVTDESC3094:0 "After the expulsion of the Jesuits from Spain (1767), Moñino was sent to Rome as ambassador to obtain the papal suppression of the Society of Jesus. He was ennobled (1773) for the success of his mission. In 1776 Charles III appointed him chief minister. Under Conde de Floridablanca, as he was simply known in Spain, the Spanish enlightened despotism reached its peak, and his internal reforms, notably in finance, helped centralize the state. This, however, brought him into conflict with especially the Aragonese faction at court who accused him of embezzlement. After serving a three-year sentence he withdrew from public life. At the age of eighty he made a comeback into political life as he accepted the title of President of the Supreme Central and Governmental Junta that led the defense against Napoleon in 1808."
# flavor_spa.EVTDESC1007:0 "The Italian Wars were a series of wars between 1494 and 1559 that involved most Italian city-states, the Papal State and drew in major powers like France, Spain and the Holy Roman Empire. The earlier War of Lombardy against the Republic of Venice had left the Duchy of Milan seeking an ally and turned to Charles VIII of France for help. Using the House of Valois' old claim to the throne of Naples as a pretext when Ferdinand I of Naples died, Charles invaded the peninsula in 1494. With his army followed a large and mobile siege train that battered down the medieval city walls in a matter of days - triggering the reforms that led to the fortification style called 'Trace Italienne.' Despite tactical victories in the field, Charles became cut off from France and was forced to return home in 1498. The conflict over Italy was, however, far from over and the wars between Spain and France would go on for another 61 years."

# desc_spa_new_colonial_reforms:0 "We have reformed our colonial administration and modernized many of the rules that govern our colonial subjects. Revenue collection has become much more efficient and the economies of the colonies themselves seem to be developing. The great number of newly appointed colonial administrators from the mainland has, however, created tensions between the Creole population present in many of our colonies."
# flavor_spa.3.d:0 "With the fall of Granada the last Muslim bastion of the Iberian Peninsula is now in Christian hands. Among our subjects there are still, however, a large number of Jews, Muslims and converts of questionable sincerity known as Marranos and Moriscos.\nIn order to create a truly universal Catholic state it has been suggested that we force our Jewish population to either convert or leave the country forever with what possessions they have that are not of precious metals."
# flavor_spa.4.d:0 "Up until now the Spanish [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has technically been the ruler of many states that together have been known as Spain. With the recent centralization of the government, however, and the creation of a new type of Parliament in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has suggested that it is time that we abolish the power of the local Cortes of the Spanish states. While this will not be an easy undertaking the alternative is to risk having the local Cortes stifle our new Parliamentary system with their old provincial interests."
# flavor_spa.9.d:0 "With its strongly Catholic history and identity the kingdom of Spain has not seen widespread interest in the Protestant reformation. There are, however, rumors of small groups of intellectuals secretly meeting to discuss these matters in larger cities. It is therefore with some concern that news has reached our most catholic majesty that the New Testament has been translated into Spanish by our countryman Francisco de Enzinas. While the printing presses in Spain itself are tightly controlled by the state it seems the printers of the Low Countries feel no obligation to protect the tender minds of our subjects. The Holy Inquisition has asked us to make an example of any Protestants they can find in our country to track down those who would bring the book into Spain as well as any Crypto-Lutherans inside our borders."
# flavor_spa.12.d:0 "The Society of Jesus has played a very active part in the history of our country through the years both as agents of the Counter-Reformation and as facilitators of the colonization and conversion of the Americas. Through the centuries the order has come to wield considerable political power, especially in the colonies, where it has over time grown to become something of a nuisance. Our colonial administrators and landowners complain that the Jesuits protect runaway Indian slaves and that some of their reductions take up valuable land that would serve much better as a direct part of our country. The Order has also used its influence more than once to deflect or prevent our political goals and many suspect they support autonomy for our colonial possessions. The defenders of the Jesuits, however, claim that they bring many indirect benefits to our colonies and that we will see far from beneficial long term effects from expelling the order."
# flavor_fra.EVTDESC3105:0 "In 1442 René of Anjou lost control of the Kingdom of Naples to the Trastamara dynasty. Though he would never reacquire the crown himself René continued to style himself King of Naples throughout his life. With René now gone the Anjou claims to the kingdom are looking increasingly inconsequential.\nThe Neapolitan Kingdom is not without its enemies, however, and some Italian princes have approached [Root.Monarch.GetName] suggesting that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could claim the Kingdom of Naples for [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] by citing the marriage ties between King René and our own dynasty in the past as a pretext. Normally this would be seen as a very weak claim but due to the impopularity of the Neapolitan rulers this might be overlooked."
# flavor_fra.EVTDESC3142:0 "Jacques Necker was originally a conservative compromise to the post as minister of finance. He, however, introduced a number of financial reforms, including a more equitable system of taxation and a plan for the funding of the national debt. In 1781 Necker was forced to announce the budget deficit in an effort to get new loans. The figures were highly colored, but everyone could now see what absurd sums the Court spent."
# flavor_fra.EVTDESC5001:0 "In 1729 Voltaire returned to France from his exile in England. Determined to present England as a model to his countrymen the great writer of the Enlightenment began writing plays in discrete imitation of Shakespeare. He also commenced work on his biography of the great Swedish King Charles XII. His greatest achievement to date, however, was published in 1734. 'Philosophical Letters' was an incisive critique of the religious establishment and the Christian philosopher Blaise Pascal. A warrant of arrest was issued in May and Voltaire was once again forced to flee Paris."

Don Afonso has had no reason for complaint and by most accounts this regency has been a just and efficient one.\nHowever, with the young king reaching majority there are now many in our court who would try to influence their monarch. Jealous of the Duke’s influence a group of noblemen has been trying to sow discord between him and the king, trying to frame him as a would-be rebel.\nIn a last attempt to mend relations the Duke of Coimbra has arrived with a number of retainers to seek an audience with Don Afonso."

# flavor_dan.EVTDESC3285:1 "Upon succeeding to the throne, [Root.Monarch.GetName] bypassed the Rigsråd and used the chancellery to grant commercial privileges to merchants, overriding the claims of Danish nobles and traders of the Hanseatic League. In 1517 [Root.Monarch.GetName] accused the governor of Copenhagen Castle of poisoning his lover Dyveke, and thereafter he ignored the Rigsråd and the royal charter. He created an essentially bourgeois government with the burgomaster of Malmø, Hans Mikkelsen, as his special counselor."
# flavor_dan.4.db:0 "Since 1439 the entirety of the Duchy of Schleswig has been a hereditary fief under the Danish crown ruled by Count Adolf of Holstein. Adolf's death has left Schleswig without a clear line of succession, however, even though the deceased duke tried to make arrangements for his favorite nephew, [Root.Monarch.GetName] to inherit both of his titles. The local nobles worry that the Duchy and County could be separated, parting their possessions and costing them dearly.\nBy guaranteeing the rights of the estates of Schleswig and Holstein as well as compensating other claimants we might be able to acquire both titles."

# flavor_dan.9.d:0 "Once the waters off Skanör-Falsterbo in Skåne were so full of herring that you 'could cut them with a dagger'. Ever since the market of Skåne has been the major entrepôt for Fish export in the Baltic as well as the main entrepôt for any goods coming from Western Europe to the eastern ports.\nLately, however, the herring has been less bountiful and this year the catch has been so poor that it is impossible to support the market itself. As the Skåne Market dies so does one of the major sources of income for the crown."
# flavor_dan.14.d:0 "What started as a small accident where two children played with candles has grown into a great fire engulfing all of Copenhagen. For four days the fire has spread from house to house in the old medieval city center, entire blocks are gone and tens of thousands have become homeless or killed. The fire has consumed a number of old and prominent buildings, among them the Copenhagen University Library with many of the works from the great minds of our country's past.\nAn ambitious restructuring plan has been suggested by our architects to rebuild what was lost, with a ban on half-timbered houses and a new network of orderly streets and blocks, far from the old medieval city that was destroyed by the fire. Others, however, point out that we would be wise to rebuild as quickly as possible, thousands are without homes and there is little room to waste any time..."
# flavor_dan.15.d:0 "The leader of the Royal Council and one of the richest men in the country, Poul Laxmand, has been murdered in broad daylight in Copenhagen. According to eyewitnesses two well-known nobles assaulted Laxmand with a knife and then threw him into a canal. As leader of the Royal Council Laxmand was a force to be reckoned with and not always on good terms with [Root.Monarch.GetName]. There are suspicions that he has not always served the good of the realm first. We might make good use of this incident to further weaken his supporters and confiscate his property. It is, however, very likely that such actions would reflect very poorly on us and some would think that [Root.Monarch.GetName] might be behind the murder [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself]."
# flavor_dan.16.d:0 "Due to our shared position as a Maritime power in the North Sea and the Baltics we have always had close relations with the trading cities of the Low Countries. While Royal Power has traditionally remained strongly tied to the nobility in Denmark, however, political power has come to rely more and more on the Burghers in the Low Countries. Now, however, our interests and challenges are so closely aligned that [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been eyeing Dutch political and economic structures for inspiration.\nGiven free hands our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is confident that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could implement a set of far-reaching reforms to empower the Danish Burghers and strengthen our economy significantly."
# flavor_dan.18.d:0 "For centuries the Oxen Road has carried armies and merchants up and down the center of Jutland. More than anything, however, it is used to bring thousands of cattle to the great market of Wedel. From there the oxen are brought via Stade, Hamburg and Lübeck and resold all over northern Germany. As population in the late 16th century continues to soar, both in northern Germany in general and the Baltic region in particular, the demand for cattle, grain and fish is rapidly rising. The size of the herds brought south are now approaching 40 000 oxen for each market.\nExport of agricultural produce and especially oxen is earning a fortune of German and Dutch money for our landed nobility and market town burghers. Some worry, however, that this development is empowering the large estates of the nobility while small time free peasants suffer... "
# flavor_dan.21.d:0 "Throughout his professional life the Bishop of Ribe, Jens Dinesen Jersin, has been a man of renown. Early in his life he attempted to reform Latin education by introducing explanations and translations in Danish rather than Latin itself. Secondly the Bishop is a proponent of a practical pious approach to faith, authoring two immensely popular religious texts, 'Vera via vitae, en riktig vei til det evige liv' and 'Troens kamp oc seier'.\nRecently, however, Jersin has been fighting popular superstition through a text titled 'Om miracler, tegn oc obenbaringer oc deris udleggelse', attempting to free the minds in his diocese of worries about the supernatural."
# flavor_hab.EVTDESC1:0 "The Privilegium Maius document was forged in the 1350s by Duke Rudolf IV of Austria. It declared Austria an 'archduchy' with similar rights to those of the Electors. The document was heavily based on the earlier Privilegium Minus which had elevated Austria from a march to a duchy in 1156. The Privilegium Maius was, however, not officially confirmed until Frederick V of Austria was elected Holy Roman Emperor in 1452, after which he could confirm it himself."
# flavor_brapru.15.d:0 "Due to lack of funds and due to an unstable political situation our predecessors have seen fit to first pawn and then sell the lands of Neumark to the Teutonic order. The area was once claimed by settlers from Brandenburg, however, and the burghers of the province claim the Order is neglecting them.\nThe Teutons have already tried to pawn Neumark to the Polish King but the Burghers of Neumark have rejected that solution. As long as order is duly compensated we have every reason to believe the Grand Master would accept if we offered to re-purchase the province."
# flavor_brapru.19.d:0 "When the Hohenzollerns acquired the March of Brandenburg in 1411 the state had a long history of being very loosely governed under Wittelsbach and Luxembourg overlords. Local nobility, clergy and the city councils have grown used to being left to their own devices. Robber barons and lawlessness are prevalent in many parts of the realm.\n\nOur dynasty has had some success in curtailing the power of the Nobility and the Burghers, often turning their strongholds into rubble in the process. We are, however, still far from the undisputed masters of these lands. Recently even the clergy, common in all parts of our administration, seem to be working against us. If we are to avoid becoming just another temporary dynasty in this region we must strongly assert our authority and build a government apparatus that we can trust."
# flavor_brapru.21.d:0 "Our extensive renovations of the twin cities of Berlin and Cölln have finally paid off. Swamps have been drained, fortifications built and a number of new well-connected suburbs have grown up around the city to house our administrators, court functionaries and the local industry needed to supply the luxury goods they require. So much has our city grown that it is no longer useful to speak of the cities of Berlin and Cölln, they have now merged to one which we will simply call Berlin.\nMost impressive of all, however, are the palaces, churches, roads, bridges and gardens in and around our new capital. In a properly grand setting such as the Albastersaal visitors can now marvel at the glorious [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family ancestry in the form of statues of our ancestors along with the major emperors of the Roman Empire."
# flavor_brapru.25.da:0 "The Hohenzollern lands are now all in the hands of [Root.Monarch.GetName] but worried minds fear that they may be split and be divided once again in the future. Indeed the March of Brandenburg itself might be split among an overabundance of sons. It is clear that once strong lands such as Saxony or Thuringia have suffered hard from being parceled out to the many heirs of the principal title holders, something [Root.Monarch.GetName] would rather avoid. Indeed even at the Imperial court we have received worried warnings that we have not sufficiently protected our succession. An Electorate is expected to be indivisible.\n\nIf we are to protect the Brandenburg Electorate forever, however, we might well have to let go of the Franconian holdings of our dynasty in Ansbach to our younger sons."
# flavor_brapru.37.d:0 "The multi-lingual Jewish scholar and philosopher Moses Mendelssohn is of humble origin. Originally intended to become a rabbi, his religious education, however, led him to [berlin_province.GetCapitalName], where he has instead risen to become a published author, highly regarded among Christians and Jews alike. His writings and publications, which are made in both German and Hebrew, along with the open discussions taking place even in his own home, are paving the way for tolerance between people on a scale unseen in [Root.Country.GetName] before.

# flavor_brapru.39.d:0 "Originally one of Martin Luther's theological closer allies, Johannes Agricola has had a bitter falling out with the great reformer. Agricola's stance in whether Mosaic Law applies to Christians is directly opposite of Luther's and the reformer is now in search of a new base from which to work and propagate. His insistence on the Gospels alone as the source for Christian conduct as well as having been seen to be favorable to a settlement with the Catholics has also made Agricola ill-regarded by the more radical reformers. His theological views would make him an excellent superintendent for the newly formed Brandenburg church, however, and a good court preacher of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]'s."

Historically this was the end of the power of the Douglas family and 3 years later all their land was confiscated and their castles demolished."
# flavor_sco.EVTDESC4:0 "John Knox became something of a spokesman for Protestantism in Scotland in the 1540s. Initially he was accompanying George Wishart on his preaching tours, but Wishart was captured and handed over to Cardinal David Beaton in St Andrews. There he was tried and burned on the stakes in 1546 for spreading Protestant heresy. Three months later Cardinal Beaton was murdered in revenge by Protestants. When John Knox arrived in St Andrews about a year later he was persuaded by scholars at the university to preach in the town. In June 1547, French assistance to fight the Protestants arrived and the castle of St Andrews which capitulated on terms that were later not kept. Knox and others were carried off to slavery in the French galleys but due to English intervention Knox was released 19 months later. He could, however, not return to Scotland and continue his preaching but had to stay under the protection of the English and had a large influence on the forming of the English Puritanism. He stayed in England until the Catholic Mary Tudor ascended the throne, at which time he thought it wise to flee to the continent. There he formulated his view that God-fearing magistrates and nobility have both the right and the duty to resist, if necessary by force, a ruler who threatens the safety of true religion. In 1559 he again was able to return to Scotland and was astounded by the progress made by the Reformed cause and by the eager reception given to him by all classes in the community."
# flavor_sco.EVTDESC5:0 "In 1557, a powerful group of nobles, called the Lords of the Congregation, drew up a Protestant proclamation which was later called the First Covenant, calling for the expulsion of the Catholic Church from Scotland. The motives, however, were probably much more to be able to confiscate the vast riches of the Catholic Church in Scotland than purely true faith."

# flavor_nor.25.d:0 "Centuries ago the Black Death devastated our lands, killing over 60% of our population, leaving large parts of the countryside entirely desolate and crushing the growing cities of the late Middle Ages. Politically this made union with the other Nordic countries a necessity and economically it left us the poorest of the members. Over time, however, the country has begun to heal. Large areas of open land and a rising economy has encouraged migration into Norway and made it easier for second or third sons to claim more lands for their families. While many on the coasts chose to migrate to the Low Countries the Norwegian inlands are experiencing an unprecedented level of population growth."

Surrounding Norwegian villages are required to provide the miners with food and other things they might need and this has over time lead to some tensions developing between the locals and the newcomers.

He becomes one of the most devoted counter reformists and enemy number one of the Protestant movement. Loyola having a soldier background makes its mark on the order, which is organized almost as an army. High priority was given both to educating missionaries but also counselors for European royal courts. This made the Jesuite order very powerful in the politic scene. 1773 the Jesuite order was dissolved by Pope Pius VI due to pressure from Christian countries in the age of enlightenment. 1814 the Jesuite order was reinstituted, however, just as a faint shadow of the powerful order it once had been."

No English governor wants to be remembered as the one to surrender Maine and in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] prominent nobles are claiming that our negotiator, William de la Pole, had no mandate to make this concession in the first place. French emissaries have repeatedly tried to remind us of this ever since the signing and [Root.Monarch.GetName] has now finally taken matters in his own hands and shown up at the walls of Le Mans, demanding the city to surrender.\nUnless we surrender Maine to the French we are very likely looking at a hasty resumption of hostilities."
# flavor_fra.7.d:0 "In exchange for accepting the treaty of Tours in 1444 the county of Maine was promised to France. In practice, however, this has still not come to pass.

In one last attempt to force the question [Root.Monarch.GetName] has approached the county capital, Le Mans, himself and demanded the surrender of the city.\nThe local commander, however, shows no signs of intending to open the gates, despite not having a force strong enough to withstand an attack."

# desc_ven_council_of_ten_strong:0 "While originally intended to only deal with dangers to the republican system the Council of Ten has been given quite far reaching powers to do what the Great Council can't. Some feel this has been a step too far, however, and paradoxically the Council of Ten itself might be the greatest threat to the representative system currently."
# flavor_ven.24.d:0 "With over a thousand hereditary memberships, the Great Council of Venice is perhaps not always the quickest and most efficient governing body. It is therefore not surprising that the much greater flexibility of the small Council of Ten, originally intended to safeguard the republic from plots and conspiracies, has led to them assuming more and more power.\nBy increasing its own power, however, the Council of Ten decreases the influence of the more representative Great Council. Many of the families on the Great Council feel things have gone too far as while new members of the Ten are elected each year the positions are often monopolized by a small clique of old Aristocrat families. Reforms have been proposed to curtail the power of the Ten by limiting their influence to emergencies as was originally intended."
# flavor_ven.25.d:0 "The reforms to rein in the Council of Ten has calmed many of the members of the Great Council but in effect the Ten still exert a great deal of authority that they formally should not have. Given how inefficient the Great Council with its countless members can be at times this is, however, not necessarily a bad thing..."
# flavor_ven.27.d:0 "As positions on the Great Council are hereditary there is always the possibility of a noble family retaining their vote after having lost their fortunes and all other influence. As we cannot expect such noble families to labor for their living the Venetian state traditionally affords them small pensions to live on.\nWith the chaotic political situation in the east, the fall of the Byzantine Empire and the loss of Venetian influence in parts of the Eastern Mediterranean, this group of poor nobles have been growing quickly. The great number of impoverished nobles are known to spend their pensions on gambling in or near the Campo San Barnaba and some will even sell their votes to anyone willing to pay. Sometimes referred to as Barnabotti, after the Campo in which they reside, this group is still not a great problem. If this development continues, however, it might well undermine the Great Council and unduly increase the power of those with the money to pay for votes."
# flavor_ven.28.d:0 "The impoverished Barnabotti remain a big problem for our political system. Part of the problem seems to be that once they have lost everything these nobles are unlikely to rise again. If we could provide means for them to restore the former glories of their families they might once again become productive members of our society. Doing that is, however, not popular among those who would rather rely on their bought votes or who would fear more competition.\nRecently a relatively harmless proposition was put forward however, a school could be created for the children of the nobles to ensure that they are given a proper education that their parents might not be able to afford. This would also allow at least a few select of them to rise above their original status and do useful things for the state again."
# flavor_ven.31.d:0 "Ever since the Great Plague of the 1630s we have had problems filling the positions of the Venetian government. Conferring nobility on new people must be done with care, however, as any new member of the Great Council will have a vote a dramatic amount of newcomers might lead to entirely unpredictable results. It has been suggested that the best way to vet candidates for membership is to try their willingness to contribute to the state. A number of richer families might be ennobled if they contribute a good sum to the treasury. Those without wealth are simply not the kind of people we would want to decide the fate of our Republic."
# flavor_hol.8.d:0 "As a relative latecomer in the competition for colonies the Netherlands has found that many of the colonial possessions it desires have already been taken by others. With a strong navy and a willing financial sector the independent Netherlands does, however, still have considerable resources in its hands. These circumstances have led the Dutch West India Company to devise the Groot Desseyn or Grand Design for how the Netherlands might rise above its competitors.\nAccording to the plan rather than just trying to establish colonies of our own it would be more efficient to conquer those of our competitors. As a natural competitor the Portuguese colonial empire in particular has been deemed a good target for this plan, especially as Dutch investors are already involved in some of these as it is."
# flavor_hol.10.d:0 "Things are not looking as bright as they once did for the Dutch East India Company. With other European powers getting involved in the East India trade it has no longer been possible for our company to monopolize certain goods and as a result of competition prices in Europe have fallen considerably. Desperate some company officials have taken extreme measures such as torching warehouses of spices in order to keep the prices up but the long-time effects of such actions have been negligible at best.\nStill all is not lost. The company still has considerable assets, experienced captains and good contacts in the East. It is, however, clear that things cannot proceed as they have done so far. Many feel that the route to go is to take a more generalist approach to East India trade rather than trying to monopolize single commodities, which has been the Company policy so far"
# flavor_hol.13.d:0 "Ever since the establishment of the Bank of Amsterdam the Dutch financial sector has been the hub of the European capital market. Dutch bankers are involved in everything from the wars to the manufactories of other European powers as well as various domestic enterprises. As mercantilism and protectionism closes off many foreign markets, however, the international position that once was the strength of the Dutch Banking establishment has suddenly become a weakness. As it has become known that the Bank has allowed the Dutch government and its companies to overdraw its accounts the credibility of the institution itself is also shaken in its very foundation. The Bank of Amsterdam is now ready to declare itself insolvent and it seems only a matter of time until we see the general effect of this on the Dutch economy."
# flavor_hol.18.d:0 "Through the years since our independence the French have always been supportive of our kingdom as we had a mutual enemy in the Emperor and the heirs of Burgundy. Lately, however, French domestic policies towards the Huguenots as well as their foreign policy in our immediate surroundings have made many fear the French. Perhaps it is now time to try to gather friends before the inevitable conflict with our southern neighbor."
# flavor_hol.20.d:1 "The decision to close our borders to foreign merchants was surely a most prudent one. It has, however, cost the port of Nagasaki dearly. Some now suggest that we should in fact keep trade open with the Dutch East India Company. The Dutch view the Spanish and Portuguese with as much distrust as we do and their behavior has always been more balanced and restrained in our country. If we keep our borders open to the Dutch, however, some restrictions will surely still be needed. In the bay of Nagasaki the artificial island of Dejima was once created to house the Portuguese. If we restrict the Dutch to this island any dangerous influence will surely be stopped from spreading to the rest of our country."
# flavor_hol.23.d:0 "Throughout the history of the early Netherlands the state has been run by and for Merchant capitalists. The mayors of the cities, the heads of the East India Company and other state companies have all themselves had a background as merchants and would have had both contact and knowledge of the world of trade that would help them make economically beneficial decisions.\nThis is, however, increasingly often not the case. The issuing of state bonds to finance government enterprises has served our country well through the years but a side effect has been that there is now a whole generation of rich and influential rentiers who have little to no practical experience of trade. Critics feel that these Wig-wearers lack ambitions beyond achieving cushy government offices and that their carefulness is in fact passivity. Whether this is true or not we have come a long way from the Merchant Capitalists that used to shape the future of our state."
# flavor_pol.15.d:0 "A group of Calvinist scholars has finished a translation of the Bible into Polish. The scholars have worked from the most original sources known and there is no doubt this is a fine work.

With its old traditions and rich culture the Chimu region is perhaps likely to remain an area harder to subdue completely. On the other hand our realm owes a lot to the Chimu as their example has inspired our elites, our craftsmen and administration.\nAs their loyalties are questionable but their skills are not it has been suggested that we forbid them to serve in our armies and instead make use of the Mitma system to resettle them throughout our empire. By dispersing the Chimu as Mitmaqs they will be useful to us while at the same time unable to revolt in any meaningful way against our rule."

He is the one who organizes our military campaigns, he handles our finances and when our Tlatoani is in the field he acts in his stead.\nAbove all, however, Tlacaelel is a great champion for the worship of Huitzilopochtli and has taken a number of measures to ensure that our deity and the martial traditions that surround him is given the proper respect."
# flavor_azt.8.d:0 "Traditionally legal matters in Mesoamerican states are left to the respective judges of the subject cities. As the Aztec state has grown, however, this has led to considerable differences within its borders.

# desc_manufactories:0 "While a number of technical innovations during the course of the 16th and 17th centuries has increased the output of production for some products such as iron or cloth to an extent the biggest improvement in the field of production has come in the form of new forms of organization. By creating Manufactories, often outside the city limits, merchant capitalists can both bypass the ancient guild laws that prevent mass production in principle as well as pioneer ways to increase production through organizing and specialization of labor in one place. The forerunners of the later Industrialization are able to increase output by facilitating access to raw materials and mass organization of labor rather than by expensive new machinery. This is in itself a huge change over the often heavily regulated methods of old, however, and together with later technical advances this new mode of production will come to revolutionize society."

# shinto_events.16.d:0 "We have finally managed to curtail the Ikko-Ikki, and towns under their command. The peasantry has been disarmed and our deputies are now the only ones with authority to take up tolls, taxes and mount defenses against outsiders."
# shinto_events.18.t:0 "Support of the Ikko-Ikki"
# shinto_events.18.d:0 "We have continuously patronized the growth of temple communities and therefore we have come to be associated with the Ikko-Ikki. The leaders of the Buddhist temple communities may hold a lot of sway in our society but they are also the ardent supporters of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
# shinto_events.23.d:0 "While the main strand of philosophy was once the transition from Traditional Japanese values to the more rationalist approach of the Chinese, the focus of philosophers and scholars have now moved on to individual responsibility. Too much focus on intellect disregards the actual feelings of love and empathy which are the foundations of a functioning society.\nThe interpretations and discussions of the analects will likely continue. As they do, however, a much larger segment of society can partake due to the now widespread literacy and familiarity with the Classics and Books."
# shinto_events.26.d:0 "Ever since the arrival of the westerners some have regarded them with distrust. Their pockets are deep, their weapons powerful and, to some, their culture seems fascinating. Those that deal with these traders, however, report that the Europeans are constantly plotting against each other. Scarcely a meeting with foreign emissaries goes by in which they do not warn us of some plot or scheme by their adversaries. It is clear we are not dealing with men of honor.\nAs a new group of traders request that we increase their privileges our advisors caution us to consider the offer carefully."
# shinto_events.26.c:0 "Their business must be kept limited to [nanban_traders_here.GetCapitalName]."
# shinto_events.27.d:0 "The trade post in [nanban_traders_here.GetName] has started to attract not only merchants but also scholars and intellectuals. To these men the books that the foreigners bring are far more valuable than the goods they wish to sell. The study of western science and culture, Rangaku, is growing into its own discipline, and according to the adherents we have much to learn. Many clerics are skeptical, however, as are some Confucian scholars."
# shinto_events.27.b:0 "Their business must be kept limited to [nanban_traders_here.GetCapitalName]."
# shinto_events.29.d:0 "The meeting with the west has been quite a tumultuous encounter, and especially so for the [Root.GetAdjective]! Our efforts to welcome the western traders have brought us an unparalleled insight into European culture and good access to their goods. Enterprising Kokujin and other influentials have begun sending their sons to Europe to study the westerners first hand, trying to uncover as much as possible that we could make use of at home."
# shinto_events.30.d:0 "Over time the earnings from trade with the west have decreased from its initial high, but the influx of goods and ideas from these far-away travelers are still changing our society from what it once was. Only time will tell to what extent we might assimilate the ideals of these far-away travelers."
# shinto_events.36.d:0 "Since the first matchlocks started appearing in our lands they have gone from being a novelty to one of the more common weapons in use. As the novelty has worn off and other rulers have adopted them, these arms are no longer heralded as a revolution on the battlefield, but they remain with regiments that specialize in their use.\nIn civilian life it has also become customary to use muskets for guards and hunters."
# shinto_events.43.d:0 "The inquisition into the nature of Christianity has taken a most shocking turn, as the judges themselves have returned demanding to be baptized. One is a learned and respected neo-Confucian scholar, another a respected astronomer, and the last one of our most honorable Samurai retainers. As these men were selected as pillars of society this is an unexpected development to us all."
# shinto_events.44.b:0 "While we respect their judgment the Christians must stay."
# shinto_events.50.d:0 "In an attempt to increase [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetHerHis] authority over the Daimyo of Japan, [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetName] has been conducting nation-wide cadastral surveys. This involves measuring and counting all people, resources and ownership relations, and refashioning them according to [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetHerHis] design. It is a task given by the Emperor to our Shogun, but it is being used to turn long-standing relationships of power on their heads.\nToday the time for such a survey has come for the [Root.GetName] realm. We have been approached by the administrators of the [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] administration with a proclamation stating that fiefs granted to vassals ultimately belong to the state, and that vassals hold land in trust for the present time only."
# shinto_events.58.d:0 "Our long-standing support of the Ikko-Ikki has not been without friction and in many situations it is as if there are two parallel authorities in Japan. Still, the Ikko - Ikki would arguably not have come as far as they have without our protection according to many.\nWith times of civil strife behind us many expect us to elevate the leaders of the Ikko-Ikkis to high positions and make their faith more officially sponsored by the state. To many this would be a grave insult to our old traditions however..."
# meritocracy_events.1.d:0 "Our administration is screaming for more officials than our yearly examinations can produce. Some of our ministers have suggested that we should increase the quota, allowing more to succeed so that we can fill our ranks more quickly.\nThe Grand Secretary cautions, however, that we risk the integrity of the examination process itself if we start allowing anyone but the best to pass the examinations."
# meritocracy_events.4.d:0 "The Examination System has served the Emperors of China well for centuries, in theory it allows us to ensure that only those of the best ability will be selected to act as the officials of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\nLately, however, it is widely accepted that the general level of the essays of the examinees has been decreasing. Even the work of this years optimus is much worse than the failures of some years according to the master examiners."

# personality_events.10.d:0 "What started as a dispute of minor concern between a local strongman and some of his tenants has somehow grown into a dispute of national importance. With priests, scholars, nobles and street demagogues all sharing their opinions as loudly as possible the parties of the feud have finally turned to [Root.Monarch.GetName] to have their conflict solved.\nHaving heard them plead their cases our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is convinced that the tenants, however, deplorable their situation, are the ones at fault. A just and well argued verdict is unlikely to upset anyone but it is quite tempting to use public opinion to increase our own authority over the province at this strongman's expense."
# personality_events.12.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s rule is marked by remarkable cooperation, from the bureaucrats to the simple traders and even the republican aristocracy, everyone seems to feel that our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has their good at heart. There is one group, however, that feel that [Root.Monarch.GetName] has let them down. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] own family and supporters feel we have not made enough use of our office. Their property and influence is substantial even if it has not grown much during [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] time in office and many insist that they could do great things for the republic."
# desc_secretive_new_cipher:0 "Our ruler has introduced a new cipher of his own device to be used for certain limited administrative functions in our country.

# personality_events.23.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has always considered it a virtue to listen to the advice of those that came before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] and to surround [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] with experienced advisors. It worries [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], however, that [Root.Heir.GetName] might not fully realize what ruling [Root.GetName] entails. At some point this is a responsibility that [Root.Heir.GetName] will have to shoulder, and at that time it would probably be best if [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] had been more thoroughly introduced to the challenges of rulership."
# personality_events.24.d:0 "Realizing your own deficiencies and delegating to competent people that complement your own abilities is one of the most important aspects of sound rulership. [Root.Monarch.GetName] is a firm believer in listening to good advice and in improving [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] by listening to those more experienced. Over time, however, it may be possible to learn what comes natural to others.

# expanded_arsenale_desc:0 "Since the 14th century the Arsenale of Naples has been the center of our ship production and our main naval installation. The Arsenale needs to be expanded and modernized, however, to keep up with the hostile fleets of the mediterrenean. Let us expand the maritime and naval sides of our port alike and build a more efficient Arsenale in order to maintain a larger and stronger fleet."
# tradition_of_conquest_desc:0 "Conquering people can be a tricky business, not everyone is ready for our enlightened government.

# lord_of_elephants_desc:0 "Horses are alien to Orissa and the lands here are unsuited to raise them. Our jungles are, however, famously teeming with elephants. In the dense jungles of Eastern India well executed tactical cooperation between elephants and infantry can be just as deadly as a cavalry arm. Let us further increase the size of our elephant corps and refine their tactics."
# breadbasket_of_india_desc:0 "Punjab, the land of the five rivers, is one of the most fertile regions on Earth. Apart from allowing us to export food and cotton to our neighbors this also allows our many cities to grow and encourages all sorts of specialized production. We must do our outmost to encourage the growth of agriculture and to defend our farmers from the bandits and brigands of the adjoining areas."
# encourage_indo_persian_trade_desc:0 "Situated at India's westernmost border the Punjab has always been at the crossroads of economic and cultural exchange between India and Persia. The ancient Grand Trunk Road, which connects eastern India to the Persian world, runs right through our lands before heading up into the Afghan mountain passes. These passes are, however, plagued by tribal raiders and bandits. We should encourage the traffic along this ancient and vibrant route and do everything in our power to look after the wellbeing of these traders by constructing caravansarais and policing these roads."
# reforming_the_punjabi_army_desc:0 "The ways of our forefathers were sound and have served us well over the years. In order for our armies to continue to triumph on the battlefields we must, however, aim to create a more professional force.

# merchants_of_southern_india_desc:0 "From the coast of Malabar to that of Coromandel the history of South India is closely tied to overseas trade. These lands attract all manners of merchants from west and east alike to compete and cooperate with our own merchant groups such as the itinerant Nanadesis or the Chetti merchants who travel abroad to establish their trading firms in far away ports. We must not take these traders for granted however. By establishing ports and villages that are free of taxes and tolls we may persuade domestic and foreign traders alike to keep their bases of operation in our lands rather than that of our neighbors. Let us create such sanctuaries and watch the merchants flock to our cities."
# buranjis_desc:0 "All our kings descend from the great Sukaphaa who founded our kingdom in 1228 after his long journey into Assam. Swargdeo Sukaphaa was also the first of our rulers to realize the great need of documentation for the coming generations and it was he who had the first 'Store that teaches the ignorant' or Buranji created. Thanks to this and other Buranjis created throughout the history of our kingdom we know the history of our people well and it is not hard to identify the many heirs of Sukaphaa."
# river_warfare_desc:0 "The Assamese terrain and the Brahmaputra river in particular is our greatest ally against foreign invaders. Any foreign army that wishes to advance along the Brahmaputra river will have to endure the rains of summer at which point they will have to take great care not to be cut off from their supply lines along the river. By preparing for guerilla tactics, assaulting the invaders supply lines and raiding their stores we can ensure that an enemy risk getting cut off in very hostile lands with starvation and epidemic diseases taking their toll."
# reform_paik_system_desc:0 "Since our people arrived here in the 13th century we have made use of a corvee labor system inspired by our South-East Asian roots. Paiks are used for defense, civil construction and military production and are an integral part of our kingdom. As our country grows, however, this system is in need of restructuring. A thorough reexamination of all Paik duties, Paik quotas and a new and clear graded system for the officers of the system will create a resilient system that will be of great help to us against any foreign threats."
# ahom_land_survey_desc:0 "We have observed that our western neighbors have devised an ambitious administrative system where all lands are routinely surveyed to better evaluate their worth. We should introduce similar measures here. By inviting land surveyors from the west and training our own in their methods we might be able to increase our tax revenue substantially. We must also henceforth make renewed surveys regularly to account for the changing trends of economy and demographics."
# ahom_diplomacy_desc:0 "Our country draws much of its strength from old traditions and from making the most of the resources within our borders. It is time, however, to look outwards and see what other parts of the world can offer us. By instituting official positions specifically for diplomacy and by encouraging exchange with other kingdoms we might both enrich our culture and find new allies against our local enemies."
# commedia_del_arte_desc:0 "A new form of improvisation theatre have become common in the Italian lands.

# gutnish_merchant_adventurers_desc:0 "Even back to the Viking Age Gotland has been inhabited by daring merchants, traveling far and wide to trade and bring exotic goods home to the island."
# mitma_desc:0 "In order to undertake great building projects in the past our rulers have had to fulfill ancient traditions by inviting every single petty chief in our empire to the capital in order to shower them with gifts and hold lavish feasts. As our state grows, however, this is far from an ideal way to undertake these projects. Supplying labor and materials for construction should be a duty of each and every chief in our lands."
# merchants_of_vientiane_desc:0 "The City of Vientiane has always been the commercial hub of our state. Geographically it is located in an almost perfect position to open up both river trade and communication with neighboring lands. Vientiane is, however, also situated in a place that is extremely difficult to defend. In order to allow our trade to exist and prosper we must learn how to build walls both taller and stronger than in any other part of our state to protect the wealth that so greatly benefit our people."
# bahmani_primogeniture_desc:0 "Our unusual practice of always passing the throne to the eldest son of the current ruler has at times created some instability in our realm as power hungry regents and opportunistic nobles initially showed little hesitation in trying to take advantage of a child ruler or in supporting an envious relative's claim to the throne. By now, however, the practice has become firmly institutionalized and when the time for succession comes there are very few who would oppose the true heir of our dynasty."
# siddi_diaspora_desc:0 "Trained at a young age to become expert sailors, soldiers and administrators our ancestors were once taken from their native homes in Eastern Africa. Now they man ships, desks and forts around India and Persia devoting their lives to serve masters of varying stature and importance. As the name of our state travels, however, so does a number of former slaves travel in the other direction to reach the world's only Siddi kingdom. A place to call home."
# shan_chronicles_desc:0 "Traditionally any larger Shan state keeps its own records and royal chroniclers have followed our ancestors as far back as to the beginning of our dynasty. As time goes on, however, chronicles age. By copying and preserving the annals of our predecessors we ensure that nothing is forgotten."
# cab_rainforests_of_guyana_desc:0 "The rainforests of the Guyana are teeming with life. Apart from the Imawale spirits of the forests Jaguars, Anacondas, Tarantulas and a myriad of other animals live among us and for someone who knows them they offer little direct danger. For an invading enemy, however, the rainforests of Guyana might seem like a fortress and the wild animals as its defenders."
# cab_religious_syncretism_desc:0 "The representatives of distant gods now walk our lands and many of their words are both fair and convincing. Abandoning the gods of old entirely hardly seems wise, however, and many of our people have already begun to worship the new god together with the old."
# foundation_of_bremerhaven_desc:0 "The port at Vegesack, north of Bremen, has increasingly come to serve as a new center for our shipping and shipbuilding. Here innovative entrepreneurs such as Johanne Lange have begun to apply the new shipbuilding techniques of the modern age, some even speak of a ship driven by Steam. In order to further the Bremish maritime development, however, we need to find an entirely new city at the very mouth of the River so that the access to the ocean is entirely unhindered."
# marburg_university_desc:0 "Education is important and many German universities will only receive the well to do or those of the Catholic faith. Let us found a new university that aims to be free of these restraints for the betterment of our subjects."
# hessian_mercenaries_idea_desc:0 "A modern army is expensive and training, however, rigorous is no substitute for real experience. Let us allow other states to rent entire units of our forces so that they may receive real combat experience even in times of peace but above all so that we may easier pay for their equipment and food."
# pgr_matrilinear_culture_desc:0 "Adat Perpatih is a combination of practices and rules of life for the Minangkabau people. Property and land is passed down from mother to daughter, while religious and political affairs are the responsibility of men. Tradition protects the honor and dignity of the Adat Perpatih so that, however, poor an Adat Perpatih woman may be, she will always be cared for. This ensures that our society is not divided by petty conflicts."
# bad_small_nation_diplomacy_desc:0 "Baden has always been a small state, often fragmented by the various branches of the ruling house. Over the years we have learned that the only way to maintain ourselves against greater powers is an active diplomacy."
# sdy_crossroad_of_religions_desc:0 "Our country lies at the axis of Tibet, Burma and India and the influence of all of these neighbors can be felt here. High in the mountain areas we control lie Buddhist monasteries while animist religions still thrive among the tribes in the hills. Most of the Sutiya people themselves have, however, adopted the Hindu religion of our southern neighbors. Our state is used to harboring many different faiths and this strength allows us to thrive in this heterogeneous region."
# somali_indian_ocean_trade_desc:0 "The Indian Ocean is in many ways one big economic sphere. Demand for slaves in the Indian Deccan or our abundant frankincense in Yemen dictate the conditions of our economy. Let us wisely consider our policies in regards to this trade so that we may grow fat from it rather than risk the merchants looking to the ports of our neighbors."
# peg_riches_of_pegu_desc:0 "At the mouth of the Irrawaddy river our ports are the natural entrepots for all the goods of Upper Burma. Jewels, rubies, elephants, teak, musk and other precious goods are shipped through our ports to China, India and even further west. The riches of our great city are such that the reflection of the smallest glimpse of light from our gilded cloth and walls may blind the unaware traveler at night."
# moluccan_spice_islands_desc:0 "For thousands of years the cloves, nutmeg, sandalwood and other spices from our islands have reached the finer tables in Europe, China, India and Persia. This long journey has many stops but it starts here, among our islands and the incredibly productive sources of spices that they are."
# moluccan_dominance_over_the_outer_islands_desc:0 "At a glance we would lack the population and lands to stand up to other states. What we do have, however, is a network of loyal ports and islands extending far into the archipelago that surrounds us. All these islands will support us and allows us to control their production of spices. In order to make full use of this influence, however, we must extend and enforce this network and centralize the power of our central islands."
# moluccan_four_kingdoms_desc:0 "There were once four kingdoms in the islands of Maluku and if not all of them remain they continue to play an important role both in the royal ceremonies of our people and as a common legend to gather around in times of hardship."
# moluccan_ally_papuan_raiders_desc:0 "Throughout the centuries the Papuans have raided the islands and ships of this region. With the growing European presence in the area, however, we must put such things behind us and band together against hostile outside forces."
# moluccan_pragmatic_diplomacy_desc:0 "While it is true that the Europeans seem untrustworthy they are equally treacherous to each other. Let us seek to ally these newcomers when it suits us and discard them when their help is no longer required."
# ldk_two_kingdoms_desc:0 "Once Ladakh was divided into two kingdoms ruled by two brothers. One day once a fitting monarch has been born to one of the lineages these kingdoms will once again be united and a victorious new dynasty will lead our people into the future."
# ldk_fortified_mountain_cities_desc:0 "Our country has seen enemies come and go. From the Great Tibetan Empire to the great Karkota Kingdom of Kashmir under Lalitaditya to the Islamic raiders that now haunt us. The mountains that are our home, however, are also our castles. Let us further fortify the natural defenses that we have and never fear an invader or raider again."
# ldk_wool_from_the_roof_of_the_world_desc:0 "High above the rest of the world the Ladakh plateau seemingly has little to offer compared to the fertile plains of India or even the trader cities of the Tarim Basin. For as long as anyone can remember, however, the nomadic Changpa has passed back and forth over our lands, herding their Changpa goats that give the finest wool imaginable, a highly sough after commodity to all our neighbors."
# zim_elected_administrators_desc:0 "Traditionally all important administrators, even on the local level, have been appointed from the extended royal family. As our empire has grown and matured, however, it is time we draw from the local knowledge of our subjects and allow them to elect their own administrators."
# bal_natural_defences_desc:0 "As every army since the days of Alexander has learned our lands can be quite hostile to outside invaders. Intermittent mountains with treacherous passes, deserts and hills await any enemy of ours and the population itself is used to use this terrain to its advantage to ambush and decimate any armed party intent to pass through these lands."
# orm_ormuzi_navy_desc:0 "Fishermen, traders and even pirates have always frequented our islands and our state has also maintained considerable navies. It is, however, high time we create a greater and more modern navy worthy of our kingdom's reputation as the centre of the Persian Gulf."
# kas_tarikh_i_rashidi_desc:0 "Our culture is urban yet our isolation in the far reaches of the world means that few have heard of our history or language. Let us endeavor to write down the history of our people and our cities so that the world may learn of life here in one of the more remoter, yet centrally important corners of the world."
# kas_encourage_tarim_trade_desc:0 "For centuries, even millenia, traders have dared the perilous journey to reach our desert cities. Be it to dare the Taklamakan, the Apricot Road of Baltistan or the glaciers of Ladakh they have all eventually arrived in Yarkand, Kashgar or any of our other great cities. Times change, however, and the steady stream of traders is waning, with the opening of maritime routes from east to west many no longer feel the long land journey to be worth it. Let us act decisively to protect the overland trade by abolishing any direct taxes or fees."
# lux_spanish_road_desc:0 "The great military route known as the Spanish Road runs through our lands. Let us make good use of this circumstance in our own military endeavor to reinforce our armies more efficiently!"
# yor_legend_of_prataparudra_desc:0 "The last Kakitya ruler, Prataparudra II, died as a prisoner of the Sultanate forces that subdued his kingdom. According to some, however, he survived and granted on his vassals the right to found new kingdoms, such as our state. Let us promote this legend and have it written down so that generations to come can learn of the roots of our great state."
# yor_diamond_mines_of_kollur_desc:0 "Andhra is home to some of the greatest Diamond mines in the world. Over the centuries these great mines have been the source of both the majority of the worlds known diamonds but also great stones such as the Koh-i-Noor. It is time, however, that we modernize our great mines and take care to develop them to their full potential."
# lon_expand_navy_desc:0 "Asturian sailors have for centuries lent us their experience and maritime traditions. It is, however, time to modernize and expand the Leonese navy. We must create proper naval bases along the coast and commence the construction of a large new permanent navy."
# nzh_issue_land_reforms_desc:0 "Situated at the border of Russian lands and the endless steppes and their raiders, the provinces of Nizhny Novgorod have never been as organized as the Russian interior. Vast forests and remote villages has resulted in a more self reliant spirit among our people. It is, however, time to establish a reliable and predictable system of taxation. So that we can bring law and order even to the most remote areas under our rule."
# nzh_russian_ambition_desc:0 "For centuries other Russian principalities have looked at us with condescension or greedy eyes, considering our city an insignificant border town. But no more. Nizhny shall rise to challenge the beauty and splendor of them all. Even Moscow and Novgorod will look at us with jealousy in their eyes. Let them. We'll give them a sight to behold."
# smi_regulate_southern_trade_desc:0 "The Southern Kingdoms would try to regulate our contacts with them. Especially appointed Birkarls have traditionally had a monopoly on the Sami trade and have even been told to collect taxes from our people. It is time we start to dictate the terms of this relationship and create our own trade regulations."
# smi_encourage_growth_of_the_winter_market_desc:0 "Our people live in a very widespread area and the northern winters can be both long and cold. Let us create a great common market in one a central location in which representatives of all the Samis under our control and in neighboring areas can gather. Here commerce can thrive even during the darkest winter nights and here the thing may gather to settle common issues."
# smi_standardized_literary_language_desc:0 "The Sami people may not speak one tongue but our state could certainly use a common literary language. There have been attempts to standardize such a language by various outsiders but it is high time we do create one ourselves according to our own needs."
# maz_frontier_desc:0 "For a long time Mazovia was at the border of Christendom, with pagans to the north and east. Now our enemies would pretend to be even more Catholic than we are, yet they still desire our lands. Our borders must always be well protected, our forts well maintained and our troops well trained for there is no region the enemy will pass through before reaching our fortifications."
# maz_between_monk_eagle_and_purse_desc:0 "If we are to keep our independence we need a well-trained diplomatic service. Dukes of Mazovia have often been mediators between the Polish crown and Teutonic Order and we have a tradition of successfully negotiating alliances and keeping our country safe from the ambitions of our neighbors."
# maz_szlachta_zasciankowa_desc:0 "They may live in peasant­like mansions, they may often own only one eight of a single village and sometimes they might not be able to afford a horse – but they are nobility, and they do make large percent of Mazovian population. We have to accept that nobilitatis Polonis est aequalis, and make good use of these men as low ranking officers and dragoons."
# maz_emporium_desc:0 "Trade is what fills our coffers and what makes our cities grow. Mazovia's location allows it to control much of the trade of our region as both the Polish-Lithuanian trade and the northward stream of Grain from the Ruthenia flows through our lands. Let us encourage traders to use our country as the great Emporium of the Polish lands."
# french_renaissance_palaces_desc:0 "Our ancestors used to protect themselves in heavily fortified castles. With the coming of the renaissance, however, prestige and power no longer relies on such fortresses. Let us instead build magnificently decorated palaces to show our prosperity and splendor to other Frenchmen and foreigners alike."
# french_enlightenment_desc:0 "French culture and French language is the carrier of the ideas of the modern age. As the enlightenment spreads from court to court so does the respect for all things French. It would be wrong, however, to presume that this is strictly a spread of Parisian ideas and values. As French becomes the language of all courts, books and plays our influence spreads worldwide with it."
# med_strengthen_central_rule_desc:0 "When the state falters local influential elders, the Shimagile, are always ready to step in and assume responsibility for the day-to-day running of their provinces. As we move to centralize our rule, however, perhaps it is time to let these elders either assume positions in our administration or take a step back to be replaced by government appointed officials."
# med_independent_traditions_desc:0 "Over the centuries we have from time to time had to accept foreign overlords due to diplomatic circumstances beyond our control. Once our society has recovered, however, we have never hesitated to throw out any foreign officials and raise our own banners in rebellion. Whether fighting the Ethiopians to the south or the Muslim Empires to the north we must be ready to defend every last piece of our land."
# trt_river_landscape_desc:0 "A great number of tributaries to the Ganges criss cross our country. Rivers such as the Kosi, Gandak, Mahananda or Bagmati water our lands and provide transportation for our merchants. At times, however, they are also a great hindrance. Great rains can sometimes flood large areas of our state, spreading disease, destroying roads and harming our crops. As natives of these lands this is something we have grown used to handling. An invader on the other hand could easily find himself in a much harsher situation."
# heirs_of_kitara_desc:0 "Legend tells us that all the Great Lakes were once controlled by the mighty Kitara empire. It is our task to reunite what was once shattered and reclaim our rightful legacy as the true heirs of Kitara."
# mra_fresh_perspectives_desc:0 "We are well equipped to solve the many long-standing problems and conflicts of the people around Lake Malawi. Our people are relative newcomers to these lands and we are not bound by ancient traditions or preconceived notions of what is possible. Our flexibility is our strength and will allow us to dominate other powers in this region."
# mra_mlira_cult_desc:0 "Once a year we invite the heads of all royal lineages affiliated with us to our capital to perform the ritual of Mlira, the great spirit that once led our ancestors to this country. As we light the fires around Lake Malawi we affirm the position of the chiefs so that we can celebrate our mutual ties."
# mra_ivory_trade_desc:0 "Traditionally all traders of ivory converge at the southern end of Lake Malawi. From there their goods are sent south along the Shire and Zambezi river systems before they are taken over by the distribution system of the Swahili trade states. We have an excellent position to control this trade and develop the Lake Malawi trade region."
# mra_serving_abroad_desc:0 "The adventuring spirit of our people has made our warriors and traders known far beyond our borders. In every village between Lake Malawi and the sea Maravis can be found serving as soldiers or middlemen in the lucrative Gold or Ivory trades. We should encourage our men to seek their fortunes abroad so that their experience may benefit our country."
# malagasy_foreign_traders_desc:0 "Our state controls the coastline of one of the busiest parts of the Indian Ocean trade network and it is only natural that a great number of traders from a wide range of cultures reside within our borders. What we cannot risk, however, is these merchants setting up their own societies beside our own. We must forcefully integrate all foreign merchant communities and make sure that they realize how much they rely on our protection."
# malagasy_permanent_taxation_system_desc:0 "Traditionally we have relied on irregular periodic collection of revenue to finance our state. Strength of arms and religious authority has always ensured that this has worked well enough. If our state is to grow, however, the time has come to create a more efficient and reliable permanent taxation system."
# mir_twelve_sampys_desc:0 "Traditionally each village in our realm is protected by a powerful Sampy idol. With the creation of a greater Imerina Kingdom, however, this is an unnecessarily provincial custom. Let us instruct all chiefs to bring their Sampys to our capital. The twelve most powerful Sampy will be from now on protect the entire kingdom while all other Sampys must be destroyed!"
# mir_reform_the_nobility_desc:0 "For centuries the Andriana Noble class has served us well. As our realm grows larger and more modern, however, there are a number of ways in which these nobles could be made to serve us more efficiently. Let us divide the noble families into sub-castes with different tasks. We should also strengthen the authority of our fief holders and their ability to take up taxes on our behalf."
# mir_foloalinday_desc:0 "A great country requires a great army. The traditional tax of labor that all our subjects must provide gives us an excellent recruiting ground for a new, larger and better equipped force. Armed with the best weapons our state can provide, the Foloalindahy, 'the 100 000', shall be our first defense as well as our fiercest offensive force."
# bts_gifts_and_hostages_desc:0 "While our people are now united bending the knee to a common overlord has not come easy for them. By summoning all subordinate chiefs to the capital we can employ them as prestigious royal Ompanghalalan envoys. Some would call this a policy of hostage-taking, we simply see it as a way to remind our independent-minded people of their loyalties."
# zambezi_control_the_zambezi_trade_desc:0 "The Zambezi River is the artery of all trade in this region. On this river Ivory is brought from the north and west to the oceanic trade ports in the east. All local powers have a natural interest in controlling this trade but few have as natural an access to the river as we do. Let us do our utmost to shut any other states out from the Zambezi trade and force them to use us as middle men for any trade between the seaside cities and the African uplands."
# tbk_central_melting_pot_desc:0 "At the northern end of Lake Malawi our state is at a crossroads of various migrating groups. Large numbers of foreign clans are settling or passing through our lands, often bringing new materials and customs with them. While the arrival of groups such as the Kyungu or Mwaulambyas has not been without friction integrating them can certainly be to our benefit."
# tbk_office_of_the_mulwa_desc:0 "While our people have come to increasingly embrace the ancestor cult of our ruling family we need greater control over how and when they worship. Let us institute an office responsible of our main shrine that the caretakers of all other shrines must answer to. Through regularized rituals all priests and chiefs must come to our capital to profess their loyalty to their rulers."
# tbk_inter_african_trade_desc:0 "While people and goods have always moved between the Luba region of Central Africa and the coastal region of East Africa this has mostly been direct to the kingdoms of the south, with the Zambezi as the main node of the trade network. Lately, however, the Yao peoples have become increasingly involved in moving goods between our lands and the coast and an increasing number of our own merchants are now bringing ivory, slaves, cloth, beads and mphande shells between the coast and the Kongo River basin. Let us embrace this new development and seize our place as the new entrepôt of East Africa."
# mlw_nimatnama_desc:0 "A great number of our nobles have, however, begun to commission the local Indian artisans, blending Indian and Persian fashions. Rather than try to emulate Samarkand, Shiraz or Delhi we should favor this new Indo-Muslim style by employing the best minds, voices and hands of both the Persianate and Indian worlds. Let us commission Cook Books, Kalpa Sutras and great secular pieces of architecture and enjoy the fruits of Malvi painters and singers and let others try to conserve the culture of our ancestors."
# pat_entrepot_desc:0 "Our state is a vital link in trade routes connecting China, Siam, and India. Let us promote our role as an Entrepôt and encourage merchants from China sell their goods in Pattani, where we can store them until they are sold to merchants heading west."
# cep_settling_the_islands_desc:0 "Our beautiful islands are ideally situated at the crossing between Greece and Italy and at the mouth of the Adriatic. They are also blessed with a thriving local economy built on olives, raisins and fish. Nonetheless we have a significant population shortage, especially outside the major islands of Corfu, Zakynthos and Kefalonia. Let us send word to the people of the mainland, Italian as well as Greek, that we welcome skilled newcomers and that there are fortunes to be made in these fair lands."
# cep_gate_to_the_adriatic_desc:0 "Due to their unique position our islands act as a door to the rich trading cities of the Adriatic in general and to the Venetian merchants in particular. Many influential Venetian families have a long-standing representation here due to the precious Currants and Olives we produce but it is our strategic position that will allow us to truly profit from their presence. Tolls and tariffs will ensure that we are profiting as well as we can from the rich ships that constantly pass through our waters."
# cep_entrepot_of_eastern_med_desc:0 "Ionian sailors have always frequented ports from the Black Sea to the Levant and we have long profited from our position between east and west. With the development of our navy and the growth of our economy, however, local merchants have increasingly come to organize themselves in joint companies to invest in these trading ventures. Some families now control hundreds of small ships that regularly call the ports of Rumelia and Anatolia, Crete, Cyprus, Syria, Egypt and the many trading ports of the Italian Peninsula. We must do what we can to further encourage these entrepreneurs by abolishing hindering rules, regulations and tariffs and accommodating their trade."

# ghr_52_garhs_desc:0 "Once, our kingdom was divided in 52 independent states. Each state had their own garh, a fortress around which the state was organized. Our ancestor, Kanakpal, spent 60 years uniting and integrating these fortress-states into our kingdom. To this day we employ the lessons learned and our state continues to rely on our ability to adapt to accommodate new additions to our state."
# ghr_land_of_the_gods_desc:0 "Our kingdom is blessed with a great number of temples and monasteries. For centuries pilgrims have come here seeking enlightenment and solitude. We must embrace and encourage this part of our legacy and make sure to always protect those that seek our shrines."
# ghr_crossroad_of_faiths_desc:0 "Unlike many of our neighbors our country is small and the resources are few.

# ues_agakita_shu_desc:0 "Ever since the days of the Kamakura Bakufu our northern lands have been home to the 'Agakita Shu' or Northern Agano Band.

The sons of powerful aristocratic families parade in the streets, as well as in the palaces of the Republic. At this point their rivals could never hope to find a legal way to re-establish the influence that they have lost.\n\nA legal way? Last night, a young noble was killed during a sordid fight in a tavern. The murderer is a widely known noble himself, the first son of his family. As the authorities intervene, however, the one who stands accused of this crime is someone else entirely, coincidentally the son of a master weaver who is also a prominent spokesman for the Guilds.\n\nNext morning, Guilds and Traders have begun distributing bread and weapons to the commoners; the upset crowds rally around the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s palace, and a first charge by the urban militia has caused great loss of blood and lives, before the mob could violently avenge itself.

Greater men never considered [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] a threat and others hoped to control the Empire through [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. One thing our new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has clearly demonstrated: When the need arises [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will not shy away from sinking a dagger in the back of those that trust [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]."
# harem_events.4.d:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName] has returned from [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] time as a governor.

If our favorite did learn something, that is not very apparent to us, however, and in the Harem rumors are circulating that the only way [Root.Heir.GetName] enriched himself was by lining his pocket during the local revenue collection."
# harem_events.10.d:0 "Word has reached us that the beloved and most favored of sons, [Root.Heir.GetName], is plotting against [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] father and aims to overthrow the state. Our trusted and closest consort, the Haseki Sultan, implores us to cut off this cancer from our body and have [Root.Heir.GetName] murdered.\nThere can be no doubt that the Haseki Sultan speaks out of her own interest in this matter, [Root.Heir.GetName] is no son of hers but his replacement is very likely to be. Our own ministers also speak of [Root.Heir.GetName]'s betrayal, however, and he could pose a very real threat."

# harem_events.22.d:0 "As is customary some of our provinces are governed by imperial princes so that they may learn what it is to be rulers one day. It is also understood that these provinces can serve as their base of power when the time comes to see to the succession. That struggle itself often gives ample opportunity to sort out the bad eggs.\nSometimes, however, the process can be even more hasty. It seems one of our Prince-Governor's has managed to actively destroy the resources under his control. If nothing is done soon revenue will be permanently reduced. Unfortunately, however, the Royal Prince, while not our favorite does have support from some influential groups in [Root.Owner.Capital.GetCapitalName], if we are to withdraw his assignment there will be some backlash."
# fetishist_flavor.152.d:0 "In the recent upheaval in [wrath_of_mwari.GetName] local chiefs under our command have seen fit to punish captured enemy leaders by execution. In doing so, however, they did not consult the diviners of Mwari and have broken a number of his rules. While it is clear to most that these men acted without our official sanction the fact that neither we nor the spirits of Mwari could control them has created a widespread unrest. Especially as locals are claiming that Mwari himself has spoken to show his great dissatisfaction with the way things have transpired."
# fetishist_flavor.170.c.tt:0 "As the spouse of the Cwezi Spirit [Root.Owner.Consort.GetName] will be able to act on our behalf and stop this. She will, however, be unable to serve as the queen of our country ever after."

They are stressing how vital this year's harvest will be for the future prosperity of the region."
# fetishist_flavor.416.d:0 "The wise Buddha taught us to follow the Noble Eightfold Path in order to be released from the eternal cycle of death and rebirth. The Fourth Path, 'Samyag Karman' or Right Action, says that we must not perform sensual misconduct, take that which is not ours, injure or kill. In many ways, Samyag Karman has made our nation stable and prosperous, but it does have its disadvantages. As not to displease the Buddha, monks in the [no_killing_province.GetName] province have been encouraging our subjects not to join the army. At first their influence was negligible, however, over time the word has spread and we are starting to feel the consequences."
# fetishist_flavor.457.d:0 "Our adoption of Islam as our new religion has generally been quite frictionless. At least in the areas where Muslims are still not a majority. In [Root.GetName], however, the new religion has a great number of practitioners, some who feel our theology is a bit on the liberal side. A recent influx of converts from the less religiously orthodox part of the country has created notable tensions. In order to control his subjects our local representative has brought even more recent converts as soldiers which has only inflamed the situation further. It seems but a matter of time before violence erupts..."
# fetishist_flavor.461.d:0 "Over time an increasing number of fire temples have been consecrated using the original fire that was brought to us by the followers of Zoroaster. As the faith becomes more common, however, it has also managed to anger some of our more traditionally oriented of our subjects. A fire temple consecrated quite close to the shrine of one of the more venerated ancestors in [Root.GetName] has led to open hostility between the followers of the old ways and the 'Magi' from the east. The traditionalists have stormed into the temple and extinguished the holy fire."
# consort_events.1.db:0 "Ruling a great [Root.GovernmentName] can be busy work and [Root.Monarch.GetName] has never shied away from that challenge. As the years go by, however, it has become increasingly clear that our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is not devoting the expected time and effort to find a new wife. While it is reasonable to expect a certain period of mourning that time is now long past.\nIt is high time [Root.Monarch.GetName] takes a new spouse. Luckily, when you are a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] the high ranking families of the realm are eager to lend a helping hand."
# consort_events.201.da:0 "As devout Catholics, the only way to end a marriage is to request a special dispensation from the Pope, [PAP.Monarch.GetName]. Under normal circumstances, [PAP.Monarch.GetSheHe] would be very unlikely to grant such a request, however, if we can leverage some of our influence over [PAP.GetName], the Pope might have no option but to say yes."
# consort_events.202.d:0 "The Father has taught us that marriage, the union between a man and a woman, is holy. Once they have made their promise before God, nothing can break the link between them but death. However, life is sometimes more complicated that what can be read in the Bible. [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName] is requesting an annulment of the marriage between [From.Monarch.GetHerHim] and [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] [From.Consort.GetWifeHusband], [Root.Consort.GetTitle] [Root.Consort.GetName]. Normally, we would not consider granting such a request under these circumstances, however, [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] does hold some influence over us."
# revolutionary_republic_factions.0.d:0 "Breaking the chains of the old regime has finally freed the top of the officer corps from the restraining links between birth and promotion. No doubt our army will soon be lead by men of merit that will outclass the old crops of aristocrats. Right now, however, the sudden lack of experienced officers at the top as well as the great influx of new recruits at the bottom has led to a somewhat volatile atmosphere in our ranks. Patriotism and revolutionary fervor is a strong motivator but without able leadership any army can find itself unable to perform to expectations."
# revolutionary_republic_factions.7.d:0 "Crushing the old order has brought unparalleled justice and equality to the masses as well as substantial assets into the state treasury. It has, however, also meant a loss of experienced administrators, bureaucrats and clerics. $RR_GIRONDISTS$ have quickly become the faction of many of the various remaining members of the old establishment and while they claim to support the revolution in every principle they are dismayed by the direction things have taken lately. Many of these sons of lesser nobility, the old clergy and other privileged classes have withdrawn from public life and are leaving the country fearing for their lives.\nThis has left us with a state that has more to administrate but fewer people with the required experience to do so. With merit as the guiding principle of government we are certain to find new able citizens to take their place but this has still placed us in a bit of a situation for the time being."
# revolutionary_republic_factions.9.d:0 "Fearing the influence of crypto-monarchists and anti-revolutionaries among the ruling elite the people of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] have taken to the streets to defend the spirit of the revolution. Everyone remotely associated with the old order, from [Root.Owner.Religion.GetName] priests, to members of the lesser nobility or even those already imprisoned for their crimes against the state have been targeted as radical $RR_JACOBINS$ do their best to inflame the hearts and minds of the masses.\nThis leaves the government in a somewhat precarious situation. Some of the persons being targeted are members of their own ranks, and these uncontrolled massacres are making us appear weak as it severely harms the well-being of our once beautiful city. Should we do anything to stop it, however, it will play right into the hands of the Jacobins..."

While national debt is far from unheard of we need to come up with better plans for raising money.

# orthodox_icon_events.1.d:0 "Mourning the loss of both his entire family and his countryside farm a man from the war-torn province of [eleusa_church_province.GetName] reportedly spent a day and a night praying before the Eleusa icon of the [eleusa_church_province.GetCapitalName] cathedral. As the city itself was under occupation his sorrow was shared by many of his [Root.GetAdjective] brethren. The very next day it was as if the icon had heard his prayers. The loyal people of [eleusa_church_province.GetName] rose as one and evicted the remaining enemy forces.\nThe continued fortunes of the province seem unclear but as war and devastation haunt the [Root.GetAdjective] countryside many of our citizens are turning to the church for consolation and moral support."
# orthodox_icon_events.3.d:0 "A recent recruitment campaign in [michael_icon_church_province.GetName] has given rise to an unprecedented number of new recruits enlisting. The local clergy is convinced that this was the result of the widespread religious fervor that our icon of St. Michael has inspired. They report that young men have been coming from all parts of the area to see the icon of the Archistrategos and that they leave with a strong will to go to war in the name of their faith."
# orthodox_icon_events.6.d:0 "The clergy of [climacus_church_province.GetCapitalName] cathedral claim that it is thanks to the strong local veneration of John Climacus, and the example he set for self-improvement, that the entire province now blossoms so. Indeed harvests seem more plentiful and the people more at peace and loyal than ever before. The 'Ladder' of John Climacus has helped many to improve themselves over the centuries and now we seem once again to be in his debt."
# siberian_events.3.d:0 "The abundance of fur-clad animals in Siberia is a veritable treasure trove, not only for our country, but also for many of our poor serfs and townspeople. It has become increasingly common for adventurous men to form fur-hunting or trading expeditions, traveling far beyond our most distant settlements. When they return they bring precious sable and squirrel furs, worth a fortune back in [russian_center_of_trade.GetName].\nAt times, however, it seems some of them are willing to go very far in their pursuit of wealth. The cutthroat conduct of our 'traders' has enraged the tribal population in [siberian_frontier_province.GetName] and is causing a risk to the local settlement there."
# siberian_events.4.d:0 "Groups of Cossack explorers have penetrated deep along the rivers of Siberia. Such private expeditions can sometimes be as much of a hindrance as they are beneficial, as the free-minded Cossacks have few qualms about using force, coercion or duplicity to get their way among the local population and states they come across.\nThe expedition that returns today brings good news, they have brought us new charts, as well as valuable goods."
# siberian_events.5.d:0 "Entrepreneurs sometimes fund Cossack explorers to penetrate deep along the rivers of Siberia. These expeditions can sometimes be as much of a hindrance as they are beneficial, as the free-minded Cossacks have few qualms about using force, coercion or duplicity to get their way among the local population and states they come across.\nA recently returned expedition has enriched the participants themselves but left us in conflict with a local tribe as well as one of our neighboring countries."
# desc_tatar_feudatories:0 "The Church may not approve but we have afforded rights to the Muslim Tatars in our country in exchange for their military service."
# russian_principality_events.1.d:0 "Ever since the days of the Kievan Rus the Russian principalities have employed a method of succession based on lateral seniority. Often this means that our dynasty will be ruled by its most powerful scion but at times this has left other claimants wanting to bypass the Kievan order.\nEver since the passing of $PREVIOUS_MONARCH$ the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family has been divided between those that support [Root.Heir.GetName] and those that would rather see the dynamic prince of [appanage_province.GetName] as the future heir. The young prince has wasted little time convincing as many of his uncles and siblings as possible to support him and his faction has now delivered an ultimatum to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
# russian_principality_events.2.d:0 "An unusually prolonged period of peace and stability has allowed the peasants in large Monastic and Boyar estates to begin to adopt more modern farming techniques. Slash-and-burn remains the norm across large parts of our realm but with the spread of crop rotation the population in parts of our realm is growing significantly."
# russian_principality_events.8.db:0 "The Prince of [brothers_appanage.GetName] has died and [Root.Monarch.GetName] mourns the loss of a brother. As the current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] we should now redistribute the lands that up until now were an appanage of the deceased. Our remaining brothers will no doubt expect to get a part of the land but we could try to use this opportunity to increase the size of our own lands..."
# russian_principality_events.10.d:0 "As our [Root.GovernmentName] grows so does the importance of our capital in [kremlin_here.GetCapitalName]. Like many Russian cities the core of [kremlin_here.GetCapitalName] is its Kremlin which houses the elite, the administration and the military offices. Outside the walls lies an ever-growing commercial Posad district, and even further the general suburbs.\nThe entire arrangement depends on the size and strength of the Kremlin, however, and many are worried that ours is both inadequately small and old-fashioned. A state with ambitions such as ours should ensure that the Kremlin is constantly improved, expanded and well maintained."
# russian_tsardom_events.5.d:0 "In times of need the rulers of [Root.GetName] have been able to call upon the people of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to lend their support in important decisions about the continued future of our [Root.GovernmentName]. The participation in such an assembly, or Sobor, is the duty of any upstanding subject of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and can strengthen the national resolve in difficult times.\nPerhaps in this perilous age the time has come to convene a Sobor, so that we can move forward with the support of the people?"
# russian_tsardom_events.6.d:0 "As our [Root.GovernmentName] expands so does the need for more people to administer it. In the past, we have relied on local provincial governors, but over time the need to increase the number of people in the central chancellery, the [Root.GetAdjective] prikazy, has been growing greater and greater.\nUnless we increase the cadres soon we will not be able to meet the demands for more experienced clerks later on as the bureaucracy keeps on growing."
# russian_tsardom_events.7.d:0 "It has come to the attention of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] that the head of the [Root.GetInfluentialRussians] family has been amassing power and influence in a way that could make him a threat to the [Root.GovernmentName]. It is not entirely clear if the house of [Root.GetInfluentialRussians] has any aspirations against the throne, but if we want to ensure the supremacy of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]s we should act before it is too late."
# russian_tsardom_events.8.d:0 "In order to handle the growing number of provinces under our rule we have had to give a somewhat free hand to our provincial governors in appointing local clerks. In [state_with_problems.GetAreaName] this has resulted in a reduction of tax-paying peasants and those doing military service.\nIt has been strongly suggested by the central government that we move to restrict those who can take up service in the administration so that we can ensure that our armies and coffers do not lack for men."
# russian_tsardom_events.11.d:0 "In many cases our local officials consider it a perk of the job to be able to siphon parts of the local taxes and tributes into their own pockets.\nThe governor of [corrupt_governor.GetAreaName] seems to have crossed a line, however, as the local population in the area has risen in revolt due to his ill-concealed attempts to enrich himself from their hard-earned toil and sweat."
# desc_fugitive_christian_converts:0 "This province has received an influx of fugitives from surrounding non-Christian provinces. The fugitives have been very willing to adopt our religion and swear loyalty to our state but it has also increased tensions in the area."

# patriarch_events.4.d:0 "Our newly appointed Metropolitan of [judaizers_province.GetAreaName] has uncovered a horrifying local heresy. He claims that the sect is denouncing the Trinity, the divinity of Christ and the ecclesiastical hierarchy. The Metropolitan has asked us to help him in this time of need as he will require many more resources to root out this heresy which is widespread among high as well as low.\nThe case seems very clear. Except it seems the sect has some supporters even in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. Can we really afford to lose the support of these men and women and are they really as heretic as the Metropolitan claims?"

The farmers have no hard currency to pay for goods and the merchants has refused to extend lines of credit to them, which has led to some losing their land and other possessions when they are unable to fulfill their debt and tax obligations. This has led to strong resentments against tax collectors and the courts, where creditors obtained and enforced judgments against debtors, and where tax collectors obtained judgments authorizing property seizures.

She soon forgot her bitterness and Safiye Sultan earned the gratitude of the Sultan by procuring more concubines for him. Murad valued her and consulted with her on political matters. Their only son Mehmed became sultan after Murad's death and Safiye became Valide Sultan - mother sultan, a title with much power. She steered [Root.GetAdjective] politics together with Gazanfer Aga, chief of the white eunuchs and head of the enderun - the imperial inner palace. During her son's military campaigns Safiye was left in charge of the treasury and managed to persuade her son to follow her advice in many political matters. Safiye was described by a Venetian ambassador as "a woman of her word, trustworthy, and I call say that in her alone have I found truth in Constantinople; therefore it will always benefit Your Serenity to promote her gratitude."."
